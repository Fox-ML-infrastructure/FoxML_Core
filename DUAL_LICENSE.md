# FoxML Core – Dual License

FoxML Core is dual-licensed under two distinct options. This document is a **high-level summary**. 

**Document Hierarchy:** In case of any conflict, the full text of `LICENSE` (AGPL-3.0) and `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` controls. `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` is the authoritative and controlling document for all commercial licensing terms, definitions, and obligations. Any conflicting statements in this document or other documentation are superseded by `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md`.

## License Option 1: GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)

**For:** Academic, personal, or open-source research use

**Terms (summary):**

- You may use, study, and modify FoxML Core under AGPL-3.0.

- If you deploy modified versions over a network, you must provide the corresponding source code to users.

- You must comply with all AGPL-3.0 obligations.

- Full terms: see `LICENSE`.

**Use this if:**

- Your use is **purely personal or academic research** (see `LEGAL/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md` for full definition).

- Your use is **non-commercial** (meaning: not for any business purpose, not for client work, not for revenue generation, and not in connection with any commercial activity).

- You are willing and able to comply with AGPL-3.0 source code disclosure requirements.

**IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS:**
- **AGPL-3.0 AND COMMERCIAL USE:** AGPL-3.0 itself **does permit commercial use**, but only if you fully comply with all copyleft obligations, including complete source-code disclosure for network use. If you use AGPL-licensed FoxML Core for any commercial purpose (as defined in `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 1), you must provide the full source code of your modifications and any derivative works to all users who interact with your system over a network. Most organizations will instead want a **commercial license** to avoid AGPL copyleft requirements and maintain proprietary control over their modifications.
- **NO BUSINESS CONTEXT:** The AGPL-3.0 version may NOT be used within any business, organization, or commercial entity, even for "research" or "experimental" purposes, without accepting full AGPL obligations. If you are a business or institution, you should assume you need a **commercial license** unless your legal team explicitly decides to accept full AGPL obligations.
- **NO MIXED USE:** You may not combine AGPL-3.0 copies with Commercial Use or use both licenses simultaneously within the same organization without a commercial agreement. If any part of your organization uses the Software for Commercial Use, all use within that organization requires a commercial license.
- **RETROACTIVE PAYMENT:** If you have used the Software commercially under AGPL-3.0 without fully complying with AGPL obligations, you must immediately obtain a commercial license and may be required to pay retroactive licensing fees.

**Note:** Academic research conducted for, funded by, sponsored by, or integrated into a commercial organization requires a commercial license. See `LEGAL/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md` for the complete definition of "non-commercial academic or personal research use."

## License Option 2: Commercial License

**For:** Any organizational or revenue-generating use.

**Terms (summary):**

- Required for internal company use (trading, forecasting, modeling, optimization, analytics).

- Required for integration into proprietary or closed-source systems.

- Allows internal modification and deployment **without** AGPL disclosure obligations.

- No requirement to open-source modifications.

- Includes standard commercial protections: liability caps, indemnity, export control compliance, force majeure, etc.

- Full terms: see `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md`.

- Your use generates revenue (directly or indirectly)
- You are a business, organization, or institution
- You deploy internally for operational purposes
