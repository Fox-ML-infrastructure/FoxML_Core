# Update Message from the Maintainer

Thank you for your patience while I worked through the documentation restructuring and licensing compliance. That was a significant undertaking—creating 55+ new documentation files, rewriting 50+ existing ones, and establishing enterprise-grade legal documentation.

**Active development is now resuming**, with focus returning to core functionality improvements, bug fixes, and feature development. Formal legal review of the commercial licensing framework is also in process.

I appreciate everyone's understanding during this necessary infrastructure work. The system is now better documented, legally compliant, and ready for continued development.

— Jennifer Lewis, Maintainer
