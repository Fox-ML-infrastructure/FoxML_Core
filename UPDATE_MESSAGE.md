# Update Message from the Maintainer

Thank you for your patience while I completed the documentation restructuring and licensing compliance work. This effort included creating **55+ new documentation files**, rewriting **50+ existing ones**, and establishing **enterprise-grade legal and commercial materials**.

With this foundation in place, **active development has now resumed**, and focus has shifted back to core functionality, stability improvements, and feature development. A formal legal review of the commercial licensing framework is also underway.

## **Current Development Status**

* **TRAINING pipeline — fully functional**

  XGBoost source-build issues and readline symbol errors resolved.

* **Orchestration — stable**

  Training orchestration is working as intended across all model families.

* **TensorFlow (GPU) — functional**

  GPU acceleration works. Some environment-specific warnings (version checks, plugin registration) are being investigated for cleanup.

* **GPU models — functional**

  TensorFlow GPU families are operational and producing artifacts.

  MetaLearning GPU usage issue resolved. Continued GPU testing and validation underway.

* **Target ranking & selection — testing**

  Validation under way before integrating directly into the TRAINING pipeline.

* **Upcoming refactors**

  Planning deeper improvements to training intelligence, model selection, and automated workflows.

## Next Steps

* Continue GPU model testing and validation
* Validate ranking/selection scripts
* Begin configuration system and logging modernization
* Reduce environment noise and streamline GPU warnings

Thank you again for your understanding during this infrastructure-heavy cycle. The system is now **clearer, more maintainable, legally compliant, and ready for continued development**.
