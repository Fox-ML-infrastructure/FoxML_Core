# Update Message from the Maintainer

Thank you for your patience while I worked through the documentation restructuring and licensing compliance. That was a significant undertaking—creating 55+ new documentation files, rewriting 50+ existing ones, and establishing enterprise-grade legal documentation.

**Active development is now resuming**, with focus returning to core functionality improvements, bug fixes, and feature development. Formal legal review of the commercial licensing framework is also in process.

**Current Development Focus:**
- **TRAINING pipeline** - ✅ **BACK TO BEING FUNCTIONAL** - Pipeline is now working correctly after fixing XGBoost installation issues and readline errors
- **GPU models** - Will be testing GPU models more later today
- **Target ranking and selection scripts** - Testing these scripts today to confirm they're working
- **Deeper refactors** - Planned for more intelligent training capabilities
- **Integration** - Target ranking functionality will eventually be rolled into the TRAINING pipeline for easier use

I appreciate everyone's understanding during this necessary infrastructure work. The system is now better documented, legally compliant, and ready for continued development.
