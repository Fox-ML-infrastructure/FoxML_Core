> **Document Hierarchy:** This is a limited-use exception to the standard licensing model. In case of any conflict, `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` is the authoritative document for commercial licensing terms, and `LICENSE` (AGPL-3.0) controls for open-source use.

---

## Overview

FoxML Core may be used **free of charge** by organizations whose primary mission is the advancement of public good, humanitarian outcomes, or charitable purposes, **provided that all of the following conditions are met**.

## Organizational Isolation Requirement

For companies or organizations that have both commercial and non-commercial activities:

- The humanitarian use must be **organizationally and operationally isolated** from any commercial activities
- Shared infrastructure, shared personnel (in their commercial capacity), or shared data pipelines between commercial and humanitarian units **disqualifies** the use from this exception
- Shell organization structures or corporate subsidiaries claiming independence from their commercial parent do not qualify

---

## Transition to Commercial Use

If an organization later transitions to commercial use, a **commercial license is required at that point**.

Transition includes:
- Generating revenue (direct or indirect) from work using FoxML Core
- Embedding FoxML Core in a commercial product
- Using FoxML Core outputs to support revenue-generating activities
- Any use that no longer satisfies all conditions of this exception

Organizations must notify the maintainer and obtain a commercial license **before** any commercial use begins.

---

## Termination

This exception is **automatically revoked** if:

- Any condition above is violated
- The organization's status changes such that it no longer qualifies as an eligible organization
- The organization transitions to commercial use without obtaining a commercial license

**Upon termination, continued use constitutes unlicensed commercial use** and is subject to the enforcement provisions in `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md`, including but not limited to copyright infringement claims, retroactive licensing fees, and statutory damages.

## Do I Qualify? (FAQ)

**Quick self-assessment:**

1. Is your organization a registered non-profit, academic institution, government research body, NGO, or charity? → Proceed to #2
2. Will this use generate **any** revenue, directly or indirectly (including lead generation, efficiency gains for commercial operations, investor signaling, or brand value)? → If yes, **you do not qualify**
3. Is the use completely isolated from any commercial activities in your organization? → If no, **you do not qualify**
4. Will you embed this in a proprietary product or redistribute commercially? → If yes, **you do not qualify**
5. Can you document the humanitarian purpose and provide attribution? → If no, **you do not qualify**

**If you answered correctly to all five questions, you likely qualify.** If you have any doubt, contact **jenn.lewis5789@gmail.com** before proceeding.

**When in doubt, ask.** Claiming this exception in bad faith does not protect you from enforcement.
