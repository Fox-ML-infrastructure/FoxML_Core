Business Formation and Insurance Status

This document provides a clear statement of my current business formation status and the remaining steps I am completing to ensure full compliance for paid consulting work.

⸻

1. Current Status

As of today:
	•	My LLC is officially formed and active in the State of Alabama. ✓
	•	My EIN has been issued. ✓
	•	My business bank account is open and active. ✓
	•	I do not currently maintain business insurance (General Liability or Professional Liability/E&O). Insurance will be obtained if a client requires it as part of their procurement or compliance requirements. Until then, maintaining insurance without active client requirements is not feasible.

Work can proceed once agreements are in place. Insurance will be obtained if mandated by client requirements.

2. Steps in Progress

2.1 LLC Formation — Completed

My single-member LLC, Fox ML Infrastructure LLC, has been successfully formed and is now active.

This provides:
	•	personal liability protection
	•	proper business structure
	•	clean invoicing and contracting
	•	eligibility for insurance and business banking

2.2 EIN Registration — Completed ✓

My Employer Identification Number (EIN) has been issued and is active.

This enables:
	•	business bank account setup
	•	tax reporting
	•	formal invoicing

2.3 Business Banking — Completed ✓

A dedicated business bank account has been opened and is active, using:
	•	Articles of Organization
	•	EIN documentation

This account is used exclusively for consulting transactions.

2.4 Business Insurance — Client-Dependent

Business insurance (General Liability and Professional Liability / Errors & Omissions) will be obtained if a client requires it as part of their procurement process or compliance requirements.

Until a client specifically requires insurance, maintaining coverage without active client requirements is not feasible. If insurance is required, it will be obtained before work begins on that engagement.

2.5 Business Email — Planned Upgrade

After banking is finalized, a dedicated domain-backed business email (e.g., @foxinfra.com or similar) will be created to ensure:
	•	professional branding
	•	separation of personal/business communication
	•	enterprise-grade expectations

Until then, communication will continue through a temporary address.

3. Expected Completion Window
	•	EIN issuance: ✓ Completed
	•	Business bank account: ✓ Completed
	•	Insurance underwriting: Will be initiated if/when a client requires it (typically same day to 72 hours after application)

Insurance will be obtained on a per-engagement basis if required by client procurement or compliance requirements.

4. Work Start Policy

To ensure compliance and protection for both client and contractor, no billable or contractually binding work will begin until the following are complete:
	1.	LLC active — ✔ Completed
	2.	EIN issued — ✔ Completed
	3.	Business bank account open — ✔ Completed
	4.	Business insurance active — Will be obtained if required by client
	5.	Business email (if required)
	6.	Master Consulting Agreement (MCA) signed
	7.	Statement of Work (SOW) approved
	8.	Upfront payment or retainer (if applicable) processed

If a client requires business insurance as part of their procurement or compliance requirements, insurance will be obtained before work begins on that engagement.
