# Communication Policy — Written Communication Requirement

All discussions regarding project scope, deliverables, timelines, or any material changes to the engagement must be made in written form.

Acceptable written communication channels include:
- Email
- Signed Statements of Work (SOW)
- Written amendment documents
- Documented project management systems agreed upon in advance
- GitHub Issues or pull request comments explicitly marked as scope-related
- Any other written medium mutually agreed upon by both parties

Verbal discussions (including phone calls, video calls, or in-person meetings) are not considered binding and will not be treated as official instructions or approved changes unless followed by written confirmation.

All project decisions, approvals, and modifications must be documented in writing to be valid. This ensures clear documentation, verifiable records, and accurate alignment on scope and expectations for both parties.
