# Current Availability and Readiness

This document outlines my present availability for consulting inquiries as well as the limitations in place while my business formation and insurance processes are being completed.

---

## 1. Current Availability

I am currently **available to review prospective client needs**, including:

- discussing high-level project goals  
- evaluating technical feasibility  
- reviewing data requirements  
- determining potential scope  
- assessing fit for a future engagement  
- answering general questions about my capabilities, workflows, and documentation  

During this stage, I can help clients understand whether their project aligns with my areas of expertise and whether a future engagement would be appropriate.

---

## 2. Limitations at This Stage

Although I am available for preliminary discussions, the following restrictions apply:

- **No formal agreements** can be signed until MCA and SOW are finalized  
- **No Statements of Work (SOWs)** will be drafted or delivered until initial discussions are complete  
- **No billable work** will be performed until agreements are in place  
- **No commitments** will be finalized until scope is agreed upon  
- **No deliverables or development** will begin until agreements are signed  

If a client requires business insurance, it will be obtained before work begins on that engagement.

## 3. Business Formation Status

I have completed the following requirements:

- LLC formation — ✓ Completed  
- EIN registration — ✓ Completed  
- Business bank account setup — ✓ Completed  

Business Insurance:

- General Liability insurance — Will be obtained if a client requires it  
- Professional Liability / Errors & Omissions (E&O) insurance — Will be obtained if a client requires it  

Until a client specifically requires insurance as part of their procurement or compliance requirements, maintaining insurance without active client requirements is not feasible. If insurance is required for an engagement, it will be obtained before work begins.

Further detail on this process is provided in the separate **Business Formation and Insurance Status** document.

## 4. What I *Can* Do Right Now

While the business setup progresses, I am able to:

- Review client project descriptions  
- Provide high-level architectural thoughts (non-binding)  
- Identify potential approaches or strategies  
- Estimate work categories (not quotes)  
- Determine whether the project is a good match for my skill set  
- Begin prioritizing which incoming inquiries to accept once fully operational  

This phase is strictly exploratory and non-contractual.

---

## 5. What I *Cannot* Do Yet

Until agreements are finalized, I cannot:

- Enter a legally binding contract (MCA and SOW must be signed first)  
- Begin engineering work  
- Access proprietary data  
- Deliver analysis or code  
- Provide pricing quotes specific to a client (preliminary estimates are available)  
- Commit to timelines or deliverables (scope discussions first)  
- Start a Statement of Work process (initial discovery required)  

If a client requires business insurance, it will be obtained before work begins on that engagement.

---

## 6. Expected Transition to Full Readiness

The following steps are complete:

1. LLC formed — ✓  
2. EIN received — ✓  
3. Business bank account active — ✓  

I am prepared to:

- conduct formal scoping meetings  
- prepare a Statement of Work  
- finalize Master Consulting Agreements  
- begin billable engineering or research work  

If a client requires business insurance (General Liability + E&O coverage), it will be obtained before work begins on that engagement. Insurance will be obtained on a per-engagement basis if required by client procurement or compliance requirements.

---

## 7. Summary

At this stage, I am open to:

- evaluating potential projects  
- discussing scope and requirements  
- determining fit  
- preparing for future engagements  

However, **no formal or billable work** will begin until Master Consulting Agreement (MCA) and Statement of Work (SOW) are finalized. If a client requires business insurance, it will be obtained before work begins on that engagement.

Clients are welcome to initiate early conversations. Insurance will be obtained on a per-engagement basis if required by client procurement or compliance requirements.
