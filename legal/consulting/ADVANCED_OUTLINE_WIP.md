ADVANCED MODULE CONTRACT

Last Updated: [Insert Date]

This document outlines the terms, expectations, and conditions for the development of Advanced Modules for the Fox ML Infrastructure (Fox-v1-infra) system, including (but not limited to) NLP integrations, alt-data pipelines, custom model extensions, enterprise-grade execution logic, or any high-complexity subsystem requested by a client.

These terms apply only to advanced, specialized, or bespoke development work and do not apply to the core Fox ML Infrastructure system.

⸻

1. Scope of Advanced Modules

Advanced Modules include any feature, subsystem, or integration requiring:
	•	significant R&D effort
	•	specialized domain knowledge
	•	extended pipeline integration
	•	large-scale data engineering
	•	multi-model orchestration
	•	cross-module architecture changes
	•	custom infrastructure logic
	•	vendor-specific adapters
	•	complex edge-case handling

Examples include:
	•	Natural Language Processing (NLP) feature pipelines
	•	Embedding-generation subsystems
	•	News/sentiment feed integrations
	•	Alt-data ingestion and alignment
	•	High-performance model training subsystems
	•	Custom execution routing logic
	•	Distributed training workflows
	•	Specialized research automation flows

The above list is not exhaustive.

⸻

2. Minimum Hour Commitment

Due to the complexity and long-term nature of Advanced Modules, a minimum commitment of 1,000 billable hours is required for all advanced engagements.

This minimum commitment ensures:
	•	consistent availability
	•	ability to deliver a complete subsystem
	•	enough time to handle real-world constraints
	•	avoidance of partial or incomplete solutions

⸻

3. Pricing

The standard consulting rate for Advanced Modules begins at:

$1,200 USD per hour

This base rate reflects:
	•	highly specialized domain work
	•	multi-stage integration
	•	high reliability requirements
	•	research, design, testing, and validation time
	•	real-world constraints and vendor differences
	•	the complexity of quant/HFT-grade systems

The hourly rate is subject to change based on:
	•	scope increases
	•	accelerated timelines
	•	additional data vendors
	•	expanded deliverables
	•	custom environments
	•	proprietary client constraints

Any rate change will be communicated before additional work proceeds.

⸻

4. Deposit Requirement

A non-refundable deposit equal to 40% of the minimum hours is required before any design, planning, or implementation begins.

Calculation:
	•	Minimum hours: 1,000
	•	Deposit: 400 hours × hourly rate

The deposit guarantees:
	•	project priority
	•	initial architecture planning
	•	environment setup
	•	client onboarding
	•	early-stage development

Work does not begin until the deposit is received.

⸻

5. Overages and Additional Hours

Due to the inherent uncertainty in specialized R&D and real-world data engineering, actual billable hours may:

exceed initial estimates.

Causes include:
	•	unexpected data anomalies
	•	vendor inconsistencies
	•	regulatory changes
	•	client-side delays
	•	new asset classes
	•	API instability
	•	production environment differences
	•	emergent complexity discovered during development

If projected hours will exceed the minimum commitment, the client will be informed and must approve additional work before continuation.

⸻

6. Scope Modification

Any change in scope — including new features, expanded data sources, additional modules, or revised requirements — will trigger a Scope Modification Event.

A Scope Modification Event may result in:
	•	revised hourly estimates
	•	rate adjustments
	•	new timelines
	•	additional testing requirements
	•	updated deliverable definitions

Work will pause until revised terms are approved.

⸻

7. Deliverables

Deliverables for Advanced Modules may include:
	•	source code
	•	module documentation
	•	architecture diagrams
	•	configuration templates
	•	integration instructions
	•	validation notebooks
	•	testing harnesses
	•	deployment notes

Delivery format will be agreed upon before development begins.

⸻

8. Intellectual Property

Unless explicitly negotiated otherwise:
	•	Fox ML Infrastructure (Fox-v1-infra) core remains © the creator.
	•	Advanced Modules developed under contract remain © the creator until final payment is received.
	•	Upon final payment, the client receives a non-exclusive license to use the completed module internally.
	•	Redistribution, resale, or external deployment requires a separate licensing agreement.

⸻

9. Termination

The client may terminate the engagement at any time.

However:
	•	The deposit is non-refundable
	•	Hours worked beyond the deposit must be paid in full
	•	Partially completed deliverables will be provided upon settlement of outstanding invoices

⸻

10. Communication and Reporting

During development, the client will receive:
	•	progress summaries
	•	milestone updates
	•	test results
	•	integration notes
	•	risk assessments

Communication cadence will be defined at the start of the engagement.
