# Intellectual Property Terms Addendum  
## Jennifer Lewis — Consulting Engagements

This document clarifies intellectual property rights, ownership boundaries, and usage permissions for work produced during consulting engagements.  
It supplements and standardizes IP-related language used in Statements of Work and Master Consulting Agreements.

---

## 1. Pre-Existing IP

Any software, frameworks, tools, or methodologies developed by Jennifer Lewis prior to the engagement remain the exclusive property of Jennifer Lewis.  
This includes, but is not limited to:

- Fox ML Infrastructure (Fox-v1-infra) system and pipelines  
- Model zoo architectures  
- Validation frameworks  
- Internal research tooling  
- HPC workflow templates  
- Development utilities  
- Any supporting documentation  

Pre-existing IP may be licensed to the client under terms defined in the Statement of Work.

---

## 2. Client-Owned Deliverables

Work that is created uniquely and exclusively for the client under Tier 2 or Tier 3 development, and paid for by the client, is considered **client-owned deliverable IP**, unless otherwise specified.  
This includes:

- custom model architectures  
- proprietary research modules  
- workflow components built solely for the client  
- internal deployment code  
- specialized integrations  

Ownership is fully transferred upon completion and payment.

---

## 3. Derivative Works and Shared Concepts

If work produced for the client incorporates or extends pre-existing IP:

- The client receives a **license** to use the derived components internally.  
- Core underlying components remain the property of Jennifer Lewis.  
- The license terms (perpetual, internal-use, non-exclusive) will be defined in the SOW.

This allows the client to use the customized system without restricting future development of similar systems.

---

## 4. Open-Source Components

If a component is released publicly under an open-source license:

- The client may use that component according to the license.  
- Any proprietary modifications made specifically for the client remain client-owned unless otherwise negotiated.

---

## 5. Reuse of Non-Proprietary Elements

General engineering patterns, architectural concepts, templates, and non-proprietary techniques may be reused in future projects.  
This includes non-client-specific improvements derived from the consulting work.

No client-specific data, models, confidential processes, or private algorithms will ever be reused.

---

## 6. Documentation

Documentation, design notes, and specifications created exclusively for the client follow the same ownership terms as deliverable code.

---

## 7. Negotiation and Custom Terms

Clients with unique IP requirements may negotiate customized terms in the Statement of Work.  
All deviations from this addendum must be mutually agreed upon in writing.
