Fix reproducibility tracking bugs and documentation links

## Bug Fixes

### Reproducibility Tracking
- Fixed `ctx` NameError in reproducibility_tracker.py (line 862)
  - Changed from `getattr(ctx, 'view', None)` to `additional_data.get('view')`
  - Resolves 86 UNKNOWN_ERROR failures that prevented metadata.json/metrics.json from being written
  - All new runs will now have complete metadata files

- Fixed feature importances save path
  - Added `view` parameter to `_save_feature_importances()`
  - Feature importances now saved under correct view directory structure
  - Path: `target_rankings/feature_importances/{target}/{view}/{symbol?}/`

- Fixed perfect CV detection false positive
  - Changed to use `primary_scores` (actual CV scores) instead of training scores
  - Explicitly overwrite training metrics with CV scores in `_compute_and_store_metrics()`
  - No longer triggers on training scores (was 0.9999, actual CV was 0.687)

- Added missing metadata diagnostic
  - Warns when metadata.json/metrics.json missing but audit_report.json exists
  - Detects partial writes from previous bugs
