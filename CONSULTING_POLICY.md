# Consulting Policy

This document outlines the professional terms under which I provide machine learning, systems engineering, and quantitative research consulting services to organizations.

**These terms apply to all clients unless a written contract (SOW/MSA) states otherwise.**

I work exclusively as an **independent contractor** with organizations, institutions, and enterprises. All engagements are conducted on a contract basis with clearly defined deliverables and professional boundaries.

⸻

1. Professional Scope

I provide consulting in the following areas:
	•	Machine learning pipeline design
	•	Data processing and leakage-safe validation
	•	Research-oriented financial modeling
	•	C++/Python hybrid systems
	•	High-performance computing workflows
	•	Architecture and systems design
	•	Code review, audit, and optimization
	•	Custom ML infrastructure development

Work is performed remotely, on a contract basis, according to clearly defined deliverables.

I do not accept W-2 employment arrangements.

⸻

2. Client Neutrality

I work with any organization that respects:
	•	contractual boundaries and professional agreements
	•	professional communication and business conduct
	•	independent contractor status and work autonomy
	•	agreed-upon scope and deliverables
	•	payment terms and invoicing processes

I do not make decisions based on client industry, institutional type, political alignment, or mission—as long as the engagement remains professional, lawful, and does not interfere with my personal life or other commitments.

3. Rates

Base Rate

$300/hr
This is the minimum billing rate for all consulting work.

Scope-Dependent Rates

Complex projects involving:
	•	full pipeline architecture
	•	C++ inference engines
	•	HFT-oriented ML systems
	•	urgent turnarounds
	•	long-horizon research
	•	high-throughput compute workflows

may be billed at a higher rate depending on required depth and time sensitivity.

Retainers & On-Call Availability

24-7 availability or priority response requires a retainer separate from hourly billing.
	•	On-call retainers start at $5,000–$15,000/month
	•	Emergency work is billed at 2×–4× the standard rate

No client is entitled to off-hours availability without a retainer.

Payment Terms

Standard payment terms (may be adjusted in SOW):
	•	Invoices issued monthly or at milestones
	•	Net 15 days payment terms
	•	Late payments accrue interest at 1.5% per month
	•	Consultant may pause work if payments become overdue

⸻

4. Work Model

Remote Only

All work is conducted remotely.
Meetings are held via video call or written channels.

Defined Deliverables

Every project requires a written Statement of Work (SOW) covering:
	•	deliverables
	•	milestones
	•	rate
	•	timelines
	•	communication expectations

No Open-Ended “Scope Creep”

Unplanned work, feature requests, or expansions are billed at the current hourly rate or added to a revised SOW.

⸻

5. Communication Policy

**Professional Communication Standards:**
	•	Communication is asynchronous unless a meeting is scheduled.
	•	All project-related communication should be professional and focused on deliverables.
	•	I reserve the right to choose not to participate in non-professional or invasive discussions.
	•	Personal life, identity, and non-work topics are not part of the engagement.
	•	Harassment, unprofessional conduct, or boundary crossing terminates the contract immediately.

**For Organizations:**
	•	Primary contact should be through designated project managers or authorized representatives.
	•	Meeting schedules and availability are defined in the SOW.
	•	Urgent requests outside normal hours require prior arrangement or retainer agreements.

⸻

6. Ownership & IP

Ownership depends on the contract.
By default (per Master Consulting Agreement):
	•	Consultant grants Client a non-exclusive, non-transferable, internal-use-only license to deliverables created during the engagement
	•	Consultant retains ownership of all deliverables, underlying methodologies, generalized techniques, architectural frameworks, reusable components, and research workflows
	•	Pre-existing IP (including Aurora-v2, pipelines, models, C++ engines) remains exclusively owned by Consultant
	•	Full ownership transfer or exclusive licensing must be negotiated explicitly in the SOW

This protects both parties and allows Consultant to reuse methodologies across engagements.

⸻

7. Confidentiality

All client materials, datasets, and proprietary information are confidential under standard NDAs or contract clauses.

I do not share or reuse client materials unless contractually permitted.

⸻

8. Termination

Either party may terminate:
	•	with 14 days' written notice, or
	•	immediately in case of material breach

Client is responsible for all work completed and billed hours up to the termination date.
Retainers are non-refundable unless stated otherwise in the SOW.

⸻

9. Contact

**For Organizations Seeking Consulting Services:**

Email: jenn.lewis5789@gmail.com  
Subject: Consulting Inquiry — [Your Organization Name]

**Initial Inquiry Should Include:**
	•	Organization name and type
	•	Brief description of project or requirements
	•	Preferred engagement timeline
	•	Any specific technical constraints or requirements

I will respond within 2-3 business days to schedule a discovery call and discuss a formal proposal.
