# **📄 Definitions & Notes**

### **Tier 0 — Baseline Advisory**

For organizations needing:

* architectural explanation
* onboarding to Aurora
* technical review
* reading/understanding codebases
* planning support

No deliverables or engineering work are produced at this tier.

---

### **Tier 1 — Engineering Support**

For organizations needing:

* improvements to existing Aurora systems
* debugging and diagnostics
* training pipeline stability work
* ensemble tuning
* minor C++ or Python modifications
* non-urgent development tasks

This tier covers **work that enhances Aurora without creating new proprietary subsystems**.

---

### **Tier 2 — Proprietary Development**

For organizations requiring:

* internal versions of Aurora
* custom ML pipelines
* HPC-integrated workflow design
* proprietary inference systems
* secure internal deployments
* new ensembles, new architectures, or new tooling
* integration with private data feeds

This is **new engineering**, not maintenance of the open-source repo.

---

### **Tier 3 — High-Urgency / Critical Response**

Reserved for:

* rapid deadlines
* urgent system issues
* time-sensitive research needs
* production failures
* on-call availability requests

---

# **📦 Retainers & Upfront Costs**

### **Retainer Options**

Monthly retainers are available for organizations that require:

* ongoing support
* periodic updates
* long-term research partnerships
* access to technical expertise on standby

Retainer engagements begin at **10–40 hours per month** depending on scope.

### **Upfront Payments**

Standard policy:

* **40% upfront** for new clients or new projects
* Remaining balance billed at milestones or monthly

This ensures project commitment and protects ongoing availability.

* deliverables
* timelines
* rate tier(s) used
* payment schedule
* responsibilities

No work begins until both parties approve the SOW.

---
