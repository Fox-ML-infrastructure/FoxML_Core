# DATA CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
data:
  # Data directory (relative to repo root or absolute path)
  data_dir: data/data_labeled_v2/interval=5m
  
  # List of symbols to use (5 symbols for comprehensive testing)
  symbols: [AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, NVDA]
  
  # Bar interval
  interval: 5m
  
  # Reduced limits for faster testing (increase for production)
  max_samples_per_symbol: 1000   # Reduced for faster testing
  max_rows_per_symbol: 1000      # Reduced for faster testing
  max_rows_train: 20000          # Reduced from 100000 for faster testing
  max_cs_samples: 1000            # Max cross-sectional samples per timestamp
  min_cs: 3                       # Reduced from 10 for faster testing

# ============================================================================
# INTELLIGENT TRAINING CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
intelligent_training:
  # Auto-discover ALL targets from data
  auto_targets: true
  
  # Evaluate top N targets (limited for faster testing)
  top_n_targets: 5  # Limited for faster testing
  
  # Maximum targets to evaluate (limited for faster testing)
  max_targets_to_evaluate: 10  # Limited for faster testing
  
  # Auto-discover features
  auto_features: true
  
  # Number of top features to select (reduced for faster testing)
  top_m_features: 30  # Reduced from 50 for faster testing
  
  # Training strategy
  strategy: single_task
  
  # Skip leakage diagnostics for faster testing
  run_leakage_diagnostics: false
  
  # Exclude target patterns (targets matching any pattern will be excluded)
  # Patterns are matched as substrings (e.g., "will_peak" matches "y_will_peak_60m_0.8")
  exclude_target_patterns:
    - "will_peak"
    - "will_valley"
    - "fwd_ret_20d"  # Exclude 20-day targets (require >20 days of data)
    - "fwd_ret_15d"  # Exclude 15-day targets (require >15 days of data)

# ============================================================================
# TARGET CONFIGURATION (Legacy/Reference)
# ============================================================================
# NOTE: When auto_targets=true, this is ignored. Only used as fallback if auto_targets=false
targets:
  # Primary target (fallback ONLY if auto_targets=false and no manual_targets)
  # primary: fwd_ret_60m  # Commented out since we're using auto_targets=true

# ============================================================================
# FEATURE SELECTION CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
feature_selection:
  # Model families to use for feature selection (comprehensive set)
  model_families:
    - lightgbm
    - xgboost
    - random_forest
    - catboost
    - neural_network
    - lasso
    - mutual_information
    - univariate_selection

# ============================================================================
# TRAINING CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
training:
  # Model families to train (same as feature selection for consistency)
  model_families:
    - lightgbm
    - xgboost
    - random_forest
    - catboost
    - neural_network
    - lasso
    - mutual_information
    - univariate_selection

# ============================================================================
# DECISION CONFIGURATION (Auto-Config Application)
# ============================================================================
decisions:
  # Application mode: "off" (assist mode only), "dry_run" (show patch), "apply" (auto-apply)
  apply_mode: "off"  # Disabled for comprehensive testing (focus on evaluation)
  
  # Minimum decision level to apply
  min_level_to_apply: 2
  
  # Bayesian patch policy (disabled for comprehensive test)
  use_bayesian: false  # Disabled to focus on raw evaluation

# ============================================================================
# PARALLEL EXECUTION CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# Multi-target parallel execution (ENABLED for faster comprehensive testing)
multi_target:
  # Enable parallel target evaluation (ProcessPoolExecutor)
  parallel_targets: true
  
  # Continue to next target if one fails (important for comprehensive test)
  skip_on_error: true
  
  # Save multi_target_summary.json
  save_summary: true

# Feature selection parallel execution (ENABLED for faster testing)
multi_model_feature_selection:
  # Enable parallel symbol processing (ProcessPoolExecutor)
  parallel_symbols: true

# Threading/parallel worker configuration
threading:
  parallel:
    # Max workers for ProcessPoolExecutor (CPU-bound tasks)
    # Set to 8 for comprehensive test (utilize all cores)
    max_workers_process: 8  # Increased for comprehensive test
    
    # Max workers for ThreadPoolExecutor (I/O-bound tasks)
    max_workers_thread: 8   # Increased for comprehensive test
    
    # Master switch for parallel execution
    enabled: true

# ============================================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================================
# - This config tests ALL discovered targets from the data
# - Parallel execution is enabled for faster testing
# - Data limits are reduced for speed (increase for production)
# - This will generate comprehensive rankings across all targets
# - Expect longer runtime but complete coverage of all targets
# - Results will show which targets are most predictable
# - Compare scores: honest baseline (~0.52-0.54) vs repainting targets (~0.70+)
