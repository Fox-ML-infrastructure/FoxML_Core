# =============================================================================
# Canonical Metric Naming
# =============================================================================
# Format: <metric_base>__<view>__<aggregation>
# - view: cs (cross-sectional) or sym (symbol-specific)
# - aggregation: mean, std, pooled
#
# This eliminates the overloaded "auc" field that stored different metrics
# depending on task type (R2 for regression, ROC-AUC for binary, etc.)
