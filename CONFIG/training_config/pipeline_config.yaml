# Training Pipeline Configuration
# Main settings for the training pipeline orchestration

pipeline:
  # Timeouts
  isolation_timeout_seconds: 7200  # 2 hours default for isolated child processes
  
  # Family-specific timeouts (in seconds)
  # Families that may need longer timeouts can be specified here
  family_timeouts:
    LSTM: 10800  # 3 hours for LSTM (can be slow with long sequences)
    Transformer: 10800  # 3 hours for Transformer (can be slow with long sequences)
    # Add more family-specific timeouts as needed
  
  # Data Processing Limits
  data_limits:
    max_samples_per_symbol: null  # None = no limit, or set to integer (e.g., 20 for testing)
    min_cross_sectional_samples: 10  # Minimum cross-sectional samples required
    max_cross_sectional_samples: null  # None = no limit, falls back to 1000 if not specified
    max_rows_train: null  # Maximum training rows (None = no limit)
    min_cs: 1  # Minimum cross-sectional samples
    default_max_samples_ranking: 10000  # Default max samples for ranking pipeline
    default_max_samples_feature_selection: 50000  # Default max samples for feature selection
    max_cs_samples: 1000  # Maximum cross-sectional samples per timestamp
    default_max_rows_per_symbol_ranking: 50000  # Default max rows per symbol for ranking
  
  # Sequential Model Settings
  sequential:
    default_lookback: 64  # Default lookback window for sequential models

  # Data Interval Detection
  data_interval:
    max_reasonable_minutes: 1440.0  # Maximum reasonable interval (1 day in minutes)
  
  # Test Configuration
  test:
    max_samples_per_symbol: 20  # Reduced for testing
    epochs: 10  # Reduced for testing

    max_samples_per_symbol: null  # No limit in production
  
  # Paths
  paths:
    data_dir: "data/data_labeled/interval=5m"  # Default data directory
    output_dir_pattern: "test_output_*"  # Output directory pattern
    joblib_temp: null  # null = use default (~/trainer_tmp/joblib), or set custom path
  
  # Polars Settings
  polars:
    enabled: true  # Use Polars for data processing
    max_threads: null  # null = use DEFAULT_THREADS, or set custom value
    cross_sectional_align_mode: "union"  # "union" or "intersection"
  
  # Determinism
  determinism:
    python_hash_seed: "42"
