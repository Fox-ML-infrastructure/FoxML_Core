# Jennifer Lewis — ML & Quantitative Systems Consultant

Independent Contractor | Machine Learning Engineering | Quantitative Research | High-Performance Systems

I build ML research pipelines, quantitative modeling infrastructure, and HPC-optimized engineering workflows for organizations that require high-performance systems without maintaining a full in-house engineering team.

Aurora-v2 :
A research-grade ML and quantitative systems architecture demonstrating production-style workflows, high-performance feature engineering, leakage-safe validation structures, and scalable model-training infrastructure.
Aurora is a reference system, not a turnkey trading bot.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Scope and Intended Audience

### Appropriate Use Cases
- Quantitative research and analysis
- ML systems evaluation and workflow study
- Academic or institutional research
- Internal engineering experimentation
- Benchmarking or architecture review

### Not Appropriate For
- Turnkey trading or financial advice
- Retail deployment or one-click strategies
- Commercial use without a license
- Running unmodified code in production HFT or trading environments

Aurora provides system architecture and research workflows. It does not provide alpha, signals, or production-ready trading strategies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Licensing Model (Dual License)

Aurora is distributed under a dual-license model.

### AGPL-3.0 (Open Source)
Permitted for:
- academic work
- personal research
- open-source contributions

AGPL requires that any modified version deployed over a network must publish those modifications under the same license.

### Commercial License (Required for Enterprise Use)
A commercial license is required for any use by businesses, institutions, or organizations, including:

- internal research and analysis
- modeling, forecasting, or optimization workflows
- trading, strategy development, or quantitative pipelines
- integration into proprietary systems or software
- any revenue-generating use

Commercial licensing provides:
- internal deployment without AGPL disclosure
- proprietary modifications
- integration support as contracted
- the ability to use Aurora within closed systems
