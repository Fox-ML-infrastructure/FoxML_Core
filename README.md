# FoxML Core — ML Cross-Sectional Infrastructure

> **⚠️ ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT — EXPECT BREAKING CHANGES**  
> This project is under **heavy active development**. Breaking changes may occur without notice. APIs, configuration schemas, directory structures, and file formats may change between commits. Use at your own risk in production environments. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for current status and known issues.

> **📝 See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for recent technical and compliance changes.**

FoxML Core is an ML infrastructure stack for cross-sectional and panel data for any machine learning applications. It provides a config-driven ML pipeline architecture designed for ML infra teams, data scientists, and researchers.

**⚠️ Development Status:** This project is under **heavy active development**. Breaking changes may occur without notice. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for current status, known issues, and planned fixes.

> **Note:** Personal / academic use is AGPL-3.0. **Company / production use requires a commercial license.**

## Quick Overview

FoxML Core provides:

- **Intelligent training pipeline** with automated target ranking and feature selection
- **GPU acceleration** for target ranking, feature selection, and model training (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost)
- **Config-based usage** with minimal command-line arguments
- **Leakage detection system** with pre-training leak detection and auto-fix
- **Single Source of Truth (SST)** config system - all 20 model families use config-driven hyperparameters
- **Multi-model training systems** with 20+ model families (GPU-accelerated)
- **Reproducibility tracking** with end-to-end reproducibility verification

**For detailed capabilities:** See [Architecture Overview](DOCS/00_executive/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)

## Domain Focus

FoxML Core is **general-purpose ML cross-sectional infrastructure** for panel data and time-series workflows. The architecture provides domain-agnostic primitives with built-in safeguards (leakage detection, temporal validation, feature registry systems).

**Domain Applications:** Financial time series, IoT sensor data, healthcare, clickstream analytics, and any panel data with temporal structure.

**For detailed domain information:** See [Architecture Overview](DOCS/00_executive/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)

## Intended Use

### Appropriate Use Cases
- Research and experimentation  
- ML workflow and architecture study  
- Institutional or academic analysis  
- Internal engineering reference  
- Benchmarking and systems review  

### Not Appropriate For
- Commercial use without a license  
- Unmodified production deployment without proper testing and validation

**FoxML Core provides ML infrastructure and architecture, not domain-specific applications or pre-built solutions.**

## Licensing & Commercial Use

> ⚠️ **BUSINESS USE REQUIRES A COMMERCIAL LICENSE**
>
> - If you're running this inside a company or fund, you almost certainly need a commercial license.
> - Non-commercial academic / personal research is allowed under AGPL-3.0 (see `LICENSE`).
> - Full details and pricing: [`LEGAL/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md`](LEGAL/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md).

FoxML Core is released under the **AGPL-3.0** license. Personal / academic research uses AGPL. Organizations using FoxML Core in production or revenue-generating environments should obtain a commercial license.

**If you are using FoxML Core inside any business or organization, assume you need a commercial license.**

### Commercial License

Commercial licensing gives your organization the right to:

**Pricing Structure:**

**Paid Pilots (Non-Negotiable Entry Point):**
- **Pilot (30 days):** $15,000–$30,000 — 1 environment, limited scope, async support
- **Pilot+ (60–90 days):** $35,000–$90,000 — 2 environments, onboarding calls, tighter success criteria
- **Credit:** 50–100% of pilot fee applies toward first-year license if converted

**Annual License Tiers** (based on using team/desk size, not total company headcount):
- **Team** (1–5 users, 1 environment): $75,000/year
- **Desk** (6–20 users, up to 2 environments): $150,000–$300,000/year
- **Division** (21–75 users, up to 3 environments): $350,000–$750,000/year
- **Enterprise** (76–250 users, multi-environment): $800,000–$2,000,000/year
- **>250 users / multi-region / regulated bank:** Custom $2,000,000+/year

**Support Add-Ons** (15–30% of license, annual):
- Standard Support (included): Email/issues, best-effort, no SLA
- Business Support: +$25,000/year
- Enterprise Support: +$75,000–$150,000/year
- Premium / 24×5: +$200,000–$400,000/year (only if we can staff it)

**Services:**
- Onboarding/Integration: $25,000–$150,000 one-time
- On-Prem/High-Security: $150,000–$500,000+ one-time (custom)

**Policy:** Licensing is scoped to the business unit/desk, not the parent company's total headcount.
