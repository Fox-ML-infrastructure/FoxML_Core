FoxML Core is an ML infrastructure stack for cross-sectional and panel data for any machine learning applications. It provides a config-driven ML pipeline architecture designed for ML infra teams, data scientists, and researchers.

> **📊 Testing & Development:** All testing, validation, and development work is performed using **5-minute interval data**. The software supports various data intervals, but all tests, benchmarks, and development workflows use 5-minute bars as the standard reference.

## Quick Overview

FoxML Core provides:

- **Intelligent training pipeline** with automated target ranking and feature selection
- **GPU acceleration** for target ranking, feature selection, and model training (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost)
- **Config-based usage** with minimal command-line arguments
- **Leakage detection system** with pre-training leak detection and auto-fix
- **Single Source of Truth (SST)** config system - all 20 model families use config-driven hyperparameters
- **Multi-model training systems** with 20+ model families (GPU-accelerated)
- **Reproducibility tracking** with end-to-end reproducibility verification
- A toaster ding will be added for the completion noise. 

**For detailed capabilities:** See [Architecture Overview](DOCS/00_executive/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)

## Domain Focus

FoxML Core is **general-purpose ML cross-sectional infrastructure** for panel data and time-series workflows. The architecture provides domain-agnostic primitives with built-in safeguards (leakage detection, temporal validation, feature registry systems).

**Domain Applications:** Financial time series, IoT sensor data, healthcare, clickstream analytics, and any panel data with temporal structure.

**For detailed domain information:** See [Architecture Overview](DOCS/00_executive/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)

## Intended Use

### Appropriate Use Cases
- Research and experimentation  
- ML workflow and architecture study  
- Institutional or academic analysis  
- Internal engineering reference  
- Benchmarking and systems review  

### Not Appropriate For
- Commercial use without a license  
- Unmodified production deployment without proper testing and validation

**FoxML Core provides ML infrastructure and architecture, not domain-specific applications or pre-built solutions.**

📧 **jenn.lewis5789@gmail.com**  
🔗 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-l-3434b3315)

All commercial licensing begins with a paid pilot. Pilot options and annual license tiers are available based on your team size, deployment requirements, and usage needs.

**Support Options:**
- **Standard Support** (included): Email/issues, best-effort response, no SLA
- **Business Support:** Response targets, business hours coverage (contact for pricing)
- **Enterprise Support:** Priority response, scheduled calls (contact for pricing)
- **Premium Support:** Extended hours, direct engineering access (contact for pricing, availability limited)

**Professional Services:**
- **Onboarding/Integration:** Training, architecture review, initial setup (contact for pricing)
- **On-Prem/High-Security Deployment:** Custom deployment and security configuration (contact for pricing)

**Important:** Licensing is scoped to the business unit/desk using the software, not the parent company's total headcount. This makes pricing accessible for teams and desks within larger organizations.

### Quick FAQ

**Q: We're a university lab—do we need a license?**  
A: If it's institutional use, sponsored/industry work, or internal tooling: yes, you need a commercial license. Pure non-commercial academic research at a qualifying tax-exempt institution: no license needed (see `LICENSE` for full definition).

**Q: Can I use it for free?**  
A: Only for personal use (individual, non-commercial) or non-commercial academic research at qualifying institutions. Any organizational use requires a commercial license.

**Q: What if I just want to evaluate it?**  
A: Organizations can evaluate for 30 days without a paid license (see `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md`). Continued use after evaluation requires a commercial license.
