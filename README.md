# Fox-v1-infra — ML & Quantitative Systems Infrastructure

> **📋 See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for most recent updates, current development focus, and status of modules (including known broken/untested components).**

*A picture is worth a thousand words* 📸 — See the [training pipeline in action](docs/images/TRAINING_PIPELINE_LOG.md) or view the [image directly](docs/images/training_pipeline_log.png).

Fox-v1-infra is a high-performance research and machine learning infrastructure stack.  
It provides a reference-grade architecture for ML pipelines, quantitative workflows, reproducible experiments, and HPC-optimized engineering without exposing proprietary signals or production-ready trading systems.

Developed and maintained by **Jennifer Lewis**

## Overview

Fox-v1-infra demonstrates:

- scalable ML workflow design  
- leakage-safe research architecture  
- high-throughput data processing  
- multi-model training systems  
- hybrid C++/Python infrastructure  
- HPC-compatible orchestration patterns  

This is a **research infrastructure system**, not a trading bot or financial product.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Intended Use

### Appropriate Use Cases
- Research and experimentation  
- ML workflow and architecture study  
- Institutional or academic analysis  
- Internal engineering reference  
- Benchmarking and systems review  

### Not Appropriate For
- Turnkey trading or retail strategy deployment  
- Financial advice or automated trading  
- Commercial use without a license  
- Unmodified production HFT or revenue-generating systems  

Fox-v1-infra provides **architecture**, not alpha.
