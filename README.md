# Fox-v1-infra — ML & Quantitative Systems Infrastructure

Fox-v1-infra is a high-performance research and machine learning infrastructure stack.  
It provides a reference-grade architecture for ML pipelines, quantitative workflows, reproducible experiments, and HPC-optimized engineering without exposing proprietary signals or production-ready trading systems.

Developed and maintained by **Jennifer Lewis**  
Independent Contractor • ML Engineering • Quantitative Research • Systems Architecture

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

Fox-v1-infra demonstrates:

- scalable ML workflow design  
- leakage-safe research architecture  
- high-throughput data processing  
- multi-model training systems  
- hybrid C++/Python infrastructure  
- HPC-compatible orchestration patterns  

This is a **research infrastructure system**, not a trading bot or financial product.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Intended Use

### Appropriate Use Cases
- Research and experimentation  
- ML workflow and architecture study  
- Institutional or academic analysis  
- Internal engineering reference  
- Benchmarking and systems review  

### Not Appropriate For
- Turnkey trading or retail strategy deployment  
- Financial advice or automated trading  
- Commercial use without a license  
- Unmodified production HFT or revenue-generating systems  

Fox-v1-infra provides **architecture**, not alpha.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Licensing (Dual-License Model)

Fox-v1-infra is distributed under a dual licensing system.

### AGPL-3.0 (Open Source)
Permitted for:
- academic research  
- personal study  
- open-source contributions  

AGPL requires that any modified version deployed over a network must publicly release those modifications.

### Commercial License (Required for Organizational Use)
Required for any use by:
- businesses, institutions, or funds  
- internal research or modeling  
- proprietary workflows  
- trading systems  
- any revenue-associated use  

Commercial licensing provides:
- internal deployment without AGPL disclosure  
- proprietary modifications  
- integration support (contracted)  
- closed-system usage rights
