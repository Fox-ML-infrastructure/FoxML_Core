## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can we evaluate without a Pilot?**  
A: Organizations can use a 30-day $0 evaluation (strict limits: non-production, no client deliverables). Continued evaluation beyond 30 days requires a paid Pilot ($35k). Academic labs may request a $0 evaluation pilot in writing (subject to approval, non-commercial research only). If you're a legal entity, you need a license for continued use.

**Q: What if the Pilot doesn't work out?**  
A: Pilot fees are non-refundable but credited 100% toward Year 1 Annual License if you convert within 60 days. If you don't convert, you retain the deliverables and documentation from the Pilot.
