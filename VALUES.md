# Aurora: Values and Purpose

## Why This License Exists

Aurora was built through personal hardship and adversity. This project represents years of work 
created in the face of discrimination, hostility, and marginalization in technical spaces.

This license exists to ensure that:

- **People who were cruel, dismissive, or harmful cannot exploit this work**
- **Institutions that protect marginalized people can benefit from it**
- **Tools are used to uplift, not exploit**
- **The communities this project aims to protect are materially supported**

## Respect for the Creator

Use of this software requires good-faith respect toward the creator and the communities it aims to protect.

This is not a legal requirement in the traditional sense, but it is a social and ethical boundary. 
Institutions that have engaged in harassment, discrimination, professional sabotage, or abuse toward 
the creator or marginalized communities are not welcome to use this software.

## Protection of Marginalized Communities

This project was built to protect and support LGBTQ+ people and other marginalized communities. 
Any use that contradicts this purpose is prohibited.

The license explicitly forbids:
- Use in systems that harm, surveil, or discriminate against marginalized groups
- Use by institutions with documented records of discrimination
- Use that benefits entities that participate in targeted harassment

## No Hostile Actors

This project is not available for use by individuals or institutions that:
- Contributed to marginalization, discouragement, or harm toward its creator
- Have policies or practices that harm LGBTQ+ people
- Participate in targeted harassment of marginalized communities
- Use their power to suppress or disadvantage vulnerable groups

This is not about personal vendetta—it's about documented behavior and institutional policies.

## The Human Behind the Code

This project has a human being behind it. Someone who faced discrimination and hostility. 
Someone who built this despite adversity.

If you were part of creating that harm, you don't get to stand on my shoulders.

If your institution has policies or practices that harm people like me, you don't get to use my work 
to further your goals.

This is a boundary. It is clear. It is enforceable. It is non-negotiable.

**This is not just code. This is protection. This is resistance. This is care.**
