# Universal Additional Permission (LGBTQ+ Protective Use Clause)

**Effective Date:** November 29, 2025  
**Copyright Holder:** Jennifer Lewis

This project is licensed under the **GNU AGPL v3.0**, with the following **additional permission** granted to certain users under strict conditions.

---

## 1. Eligible Users
This permission applies to:

- nonprofit institutions  
- academic and educational institutions  
- public hospitals or medical research centers  
- public-health agencies  
- nonprofit laboratories  
- individual researchers, scholars, and educators

**For-profit finance firms, hedge funds, proprietary trading groups, or commercial actors are not eligible.**

---

## 2. LGBTQ+ Protection Requirement (Mandatory)
Any institution or individual may rely on this additional permission **only if** they maintain:

- documented nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ individuals,  
- LGBTQ+-inclusive support, safety, or community-protection programs, and  
- practices ensuring no use of this software harms, marginalizes, or disadvantages LGBTQ+ people.

If protections are weakened or removed, this permission **automatically terminates**.

---

## 3. Permitted Uses (Only Under These Conditions)
All benefit derived from this software — financial, operational, analytical, or strategic — must be used exclusively to:

- strengthen institutional stability in ways that protect LGBTQ+ students, staff, or community members,  
- support patient care, research, public-health infrastructure, or community services,  
- fund programs that materially improve LGBTQ+ safety, resilience, or well-being.

Examples of allowed internal use:
- internal forecasting or budget modeling  
- non-commercial medical or scientific research  
- operational planning for resource support  
- patient-care optimization  
- public-health mission work

---

## 4. Finance Department Clause
Finance, budgeting, forecasting, strategy, or institutional-analysis departments **may only use this software** if:

- the institution maintains enforceable LGBTQ+ nondiscrimination protections,  
- the department adheres to those protections,  
- any financial modeling benefits are used to **shield, support, or materially protect LGBTQ+ individuals**.

Violating this clause immediately voids permission.

---

## 5. Prohibited Uses
These uses are permanently forbidden:

- commercial sale of this software or its derivatives  
- proprietary trading, hedge-fund activities, or market-making  
- alpha research, model design, or any form of profit-seeking financial exploitation  
- deployment as a commercial or public network service without full AGPL compliance  
- any use where profit or benefit is **not** reinvested into LGBTQ+ protection, public health, or community service

---

## 6. No Third-Party Transfer
This additional permission is **not transferable**.  
Institutions may not sublicense, extend, or pass this permission to others.

---

## 7. Termination
Any violation of these conditions results in **automatic and immediate termination** of this additional permission.  
Standard AGPL rights remain unaffected; only the expanded institutional permissions terminate.

---

## Automatic Termination

This Additional Permission terminates immediately and without notice if:

- the institution weakens, removes, or fails to enforce LGBTQ+ protections,
- the institution engages in any prohibited financial activity,
- the institution uses the software in any way that harms LGBTQ+ people,
- the institution uses the software for commercial, trading, or profit-seeking purposes.

Upon termination, the institution must immediately cease all institutional, operational, and analytical 
use of the software.


## No Interpretive Loopholes Clause

This Additional Permission is to be interpreted strictly and solely according to its written intent:
to ensure LGBTQ+ protection and public-interest benefit. Any attempt to reinterpret, narrow, 
redefine, or exploit wording for the purpose of bypassing these protections is invalid.

If a use-case does not clearly and unambiguously support LGBTQ+ protection or public-good missions, 
the use is prohibited.

---

## Warning Against Bad-Faith or Strategic Misuse

Any attempt to exploit, reinterpret, or narrow the meaning of this Additional Permission 
for purposes of bypassing LGBTQ+ protections or enabling financial profit-seeking is 
considered a violation. 

If a use-case is not clearly and unambiguously aligned with LGBTQ+ protection or public-good 
missions, it is prohibited.
