**Prompt:** "is there any code or files that are unused within TRAINING"

## Context
- User requested analysis of unused files in TRAINING directory
- Goal: Identify and remove unused code to reduce maintenance burden
- Scope: All files in TRAINING directory, checking imports, dynamic imports, git history, and test files

## Plan (now)

2. Remove confirmed unused files (5 files)
3. Analyze duplicate training.py files
4. Consolidate to single canonical version
5. Update all imports and documentation
6. Create audit trail

## Success criteria
- All unused files identified and removed
- Duplicate training.py files consolidated
- All imports updated to use canonical version
- Documentation updated
