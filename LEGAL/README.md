# Legal & Licensing Documentation

> **Document Hierarchy:** This directory contains guidance documents. In case of any conflict, `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` (located in repository root) is the authoritative and controlling document for all commercial licensing terms and obligations, and `LICENSE` controls for free use.

This directory contains all legal, licensing, and contracting documentation for Fox ML Infrastructure.

## Overview

This directory includes standardized documents, templates, and policies used for machine learning applications, cross-sectional ML infrastructure, and enterprise licensing.

## Business Formation Status (Updated)

As of now:

- **Fox ML Infrastructure LLC is officially formed and active.** ✓  
- Primary ML/infra engineering product line: **FoxML Core**.  
- **EIN has been issued.** ✓  
- **Business bank account is open and active.** ✓  
- **Business insurance (General Liability + E&O)** — Will be obtained if a client requires it. Until then, it is not feasible to maintain insurance without active client requirements.

Work can proceed once commercial licensing agreements are executed. Insurance will be obtained if required by enterprise procurement or compliance requirements.
