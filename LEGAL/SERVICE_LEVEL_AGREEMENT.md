## 3. Response Time Guarantees

Fox ML Infrastructure provides the following response times for Enterprise customers:

| Incident Level    | First Response Time        | Status Update Frequency |

| Major             | 2 business days            | Weekly                   |
| Minor             | 3 business days            | As progress occurs       |

Fix timelines are best-effort unless separately negotiated.
