## ⚠️ Strategic Licensing Roadmap

**v1.x is the last fully open window.** Core training infrastructure remains open for validation. Production orchestration layer will require commercial license in v2.0+.

**See [`LEGAL/ROADMAP_BOUNDARIES.md`](ROADMAP_BOUNDARIES.md) for complete details.**

## Definitions

**AGPL v3 Use:** Use under the GNU Affero General Public License v3, which requires that if you modify the software and deploy it as a service (including internal services), you must publish your modifications under AGPL v3. Suitable for open research, experimentation, and projects that can comply with copyleft requirements.

**Commercial License Use:** Use under a paid commercial license, which allows proprietary internal use, production deployments, closed-source integrations, and modifications without source disclosure obligations. Required when AGPL compliance is not possible or desired.
