FoxML Core — Commercial License Agreement (CLA v1.3)

Fox ML Infrastructure LLC
© 2025 Jennifer Lewis. All rights reserved.

This Commercial License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between Fox ML Infrastructure LLC ("Licensor") and the purchasing organization ("Licensee"). This Agreement governs commercial use of the software known as FoxML Core ("Software").

1. Definitions
Software

The FoxML Core codebase, modules, pipelines, configurations, documentation, and all updates provided under this Agreement.

Internal Use

Use of the Software solely within the Licensee's organization, accessible only to Licensee's employees or contractors under confidentiality obligations.

Derivative Works

Any modifications, extensions, or integrations created by Licensee based on the Software, used exclusively for Internal Use.

Effective Date

The earlier of (a) the date payment is received, or (b) the date this Agreement is executed by both parties.

Organization Size

Licensee's total number of employees (not engineers), used to determine the applicable annual license fee.

Authorized Users

Employees and individual contractors of Licensee who are permitted by Licensee to use the Software on Licensee's behalf, up to any seat limits specified in the Ordering Documents.

Ordering Documents

One or more Order Forms or Statements of Work executed by the parties that specify fees, term length, payment schedule, seat limits, and other commercial terms.

Affiliate

Any entity that directly or indirectly Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common Control with a party, where "Control" means ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting interests of such entity or the contractual power to direct its management and policies.

Direct Competitor

Any third party whose primary business (meaning more than fifty percent (50%) of its revenue or business activities) includes developing, licensing, or providing machine learning or quantitative trading infrastructure products or services that are substantially similar to the Software (for example, commercial platforms primarily marketed as quantitative research, ML pipeline, or trading infrastructure solutions). For the avoidance of doubt, a company that uses the Software internally for its own trading or research activities is not a Direct Competitor solely by virtue of such internal use.

Material Breach

A breach that is significant, substantial, or has a material adverse effect on the other party's rights or interests under this Agreement, including but not limited to: unauthorized distribution, reverse engineering, benchmarking without consent, or use in violation of export controls.

2. Grant of Rights

Upon receipt of payment and subject to compliance with this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to:

Use the Software for Internal Use.

Modify the Software and create Derivative Works for Internal Use.

Maintain private internal forks or repositories.

Integrate the Software with internal systems, workflows, data layers, and research infrastructure.

Use the Software solely for use by Authorized Users, up to the limits set forth in the applicable Ordering Documents.

**Authorized Users and Seat Limits.**

Use of the Software is limited to the number and type of Authorized Users specified in the applicable Ordering Document ("Seats"). Licensee shall ensure that only Authorized Users use the Software and that such use does not exceed the purchased Seats.

If Licensee exceeds the purchased Seats, Licensor may (without limiting its other rights and remedies) invoice Licensee for the excess usage at Licensor's then-current rates, and Licensee shall pay such invoice within thirty (30) days. Repeated or material excess usage (exceeding purchased Seats by more than ten percent (10%) for more than thirty (30) consecutive days) may constitute a Material Breach and grounds for termination under Section 9.

**External Contractors.**

Authorized Users may include Licensee's employees and individual contractors (including individual consultants) who are engaged by Licensee and acting solely for Licensee's benefit ("Contractors"), provided that:

(a) each Contractor is bound by written obligations of confidentiality and use restrictions no less protective of Licensor than those set forth in this Agreement;

(b) Licensee ensures that Contractors use the Software solely for Licensee's internal business purposes and not for the benefit of any other person or entity; and

(c) Licensee remains fully responsible and liable for Contractors' compliance with this Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, a Contractor may not use a single instance of the Software, or the same credentials or license, to provide services to multiple clients unless each such client is itself a separately licensed customer of Licensor under its own agreement.

This license DOES NOT permit Licensee to:

Redistribute the Software or any Derivative Works.

Provide the Software, or any substantially similar functionality, as a hosted service to third parties (including SaaS, PaaS, or multi-tenant environments) where external users access functionality primarily provided by the Software.

Build or market a product whose primary purpose is to offer FoxML-like ML/quant infrastructure as a general-purpose platform to third parties.

Provide the Software or derivatives to clients or external users.

Publish or disclose source code publicly.

Publish or disclose performance benchmarks or comparative tests involving the Software to any third party without Licensor's prior written consent (see Section 3.1 below).

Sublicense, rent, lease, sell, share, loan, or otherwise make the Software available to any third party (including but not limited to: clients, partners, vendors, or other entities) unless such third party has its own valid commercial license. Each legal entity that uses the Software must have its own license. Sharing a single license across multiple entities, even if related, is prohibited and constitutes a Material Breach.

Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive or access the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs of the Software, or any trade secrets embodied therein, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding a contractual restriction.

Use the Software to build a competing ML/quant infrastructure product.

**No Competing Service.**

Licensee shall not use the Software to develop, host, or provide any software-as-a-service, managed service, platform, or other offering that exposes to third parties functionality that is substantially similar to the Software, including without limitation:

(a) a hosted quantitative research or model-training platform for third parties;

(b) a multi-tenant or shared service that allows third parties to run experiments, training, or feature selection workflows powered by the Software; or

(c) an API, SDK, or other interface that provides third parties with direct or indirect access to the Software's core infrastructure capabilities.

For clarity, Licensee may use the Software to build and operate its own internal trading, research, or analytics systems and to provide outputs (e.g., analytics, reports, trading decisions) to its own clients, provided such clients do not receive direct or indirect access to the Software itself, including but not limited to: (i) access to the Software's APIs, (ii) ability to execute code or workflows within the Software, (iii) access to the Software's user interface, or (iv) any other means of interacting with or controlling the Software. Licensee may provide data inputs to the Software and receive outputs from the Software for delivery to clients, but clients may not themselves interact with the Software.

**3.1 Benchmarking.**

Licensee shall not publish or disclose to any third party any benchmark, performance, or comparison tests of the Software without Licensor's prior written consent.

Any breach of this Section 3.1 shall be deemed a Material Breach (as defined in Section 1) of this Agreement and may cause irreparable harm to Licensor, for which monetary damages may be an insufficient remedy. In addition to any other rights and remedies, Licensor shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or curtail any actual or threatened breach of this Section 3.1.

A Material Breach of Section 3.1 (Benchmarking) shall be grounds for immediate termination by Licensor upon written notice, without a cure period.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Licensor.

3. Restrictions

Licensee agrees NOT to:

Make the Software available to third parties outside its organization.

Publish any portion of the Software, including modified versions.

Bypass or remove copyright, license notices, or attribution.

Claim ownership of the Software or its architectural design.

Use the Software in violation of applicable law or export controls.

Use the Software in high-risk environments including but not limited to: medical diagnosis, critical infrastructure, weapons systems, life support systems, nuclear systems, or any environment where failure could result in death, serious injury, or significant property damage.

Violation constitutes a material breach and may result in immediate termination.

4. Fees & Payment Terms

Commercial licensing fees are based on Licensee's organization size, usage tier, and selected add-ons.

Specific fees, term length, and payment schedule will be set forth in one or more **Order Forms** or **Statements of Work** executed by the parties (collectively, "Ordering Documents"). If there is any conflict between this Agreement and an Ordering Document regarding fees, the Ordering Document will control.

Standard pricing tiers are published in `LEGAL/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md` for reference, but actual fees are determined by the Ordering Documents.

Payment is due within 30 days of invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing.

Renewal

Licenses renew annually at Licensor's then-current pricing (not to exceed a ten percent (10%) increase over the prior term's pricing, unless otherwise agreed in writing) unless canceled prior to the renewal date.

Failure to pay may result in suspension or termination of rights under this Agreement.

5. Updates and Upgrades

**Version Definition.** "Version" refers to a release of the Software with a distinct version number (e.g., v1.0, v1.1, v2.0).

**Updates and Upgrades.** Unless explicitly included in a separate agreement:
- Minor updates, patches, and hotfixes are NOT automatically included
- Major version upgrades are NOT automatically included
- New modules, features, or components are NOT automatically included
- Licensee must purchase separate licenses or upgrade agreements for new versions

**No Obligation.** Licensor has no obligation to provide updates, upgrades, or new versions of the Software. Licensor does not guarantee development of specific features.

9.1. No Warranty / Limitation of Liability

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

THE LICENSOR IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:
LOSS OF PROFITS, MODELING ERRORS, DATA LOSS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,
OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OF THE SOFTWARE.

**Liability Cap:** IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY LICENSEE TO LICENSOR FOR THE SOFTWARE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

9.2. Indemnity

Licensee agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Licensor from and against any third-party claims, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of Licensee's misuse of the Software, violation of this Agreement, or violation of applicable laws. Licensor will promptly notify Licensee of any such claim and Licensee will have the right to control the defense and settlement of such claim, provided that Licensee may not settle any claim that admits liability or imposes obligations on Licensor without Licensor's prior written consent.

Licensor Assignment:
Licensor may freely assign this Agreement, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of Licensor's assets. Such assignment shall not affect Licensee's rights under this Agreement.

20. Entire Agreement

This Agreement, together with any separate signed commercial agreement or Statement of Work, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written, relating to the Software.
