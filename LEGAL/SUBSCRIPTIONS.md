## License Requirements & Definitions

### Business / Internal Use

**"Business use" or "internal use"** means any Commercial Use (as defined in `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 1), including but not limited to:

- Internal tools, dashboards, or research pipelines
- Proofs of concept, evaluations, or pilot projects (regardless of whether they generate revenue or are "experimental")
- Non-revenue or "experimental" usage (even if not generating revenue, experimental use within a business context requires a commercial license)
- Use by employees, contractors, interns, or affiliates in the course of their work
- Use by sole proprietors, freelancers, or independent contractors in connection with any business activity or client work
- Use in any environment (development, testing, staging, or production) within a business or organizational context

**Any business or internal use by or for a commercial organization requires a commercial license**, regardless of whether the use directly generates revenue, is experimental, is a proof of concept, or is claimed to be "non-commercial" or "research-only." See `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 1 for the complete definition of "Commercial Use."

**30-DAY EVALUATION PERIOD FOR COMMERCIAL USE:**
Commercial organizations may evaluate the Software for up to 30 days from initial download for testing and evaluation purposes without a paid license. This evaluation period allows organizations to test the Software's functionality, performance, and suitability before committing to a commercial license. Continued use after the 30-day evaluation period requires a commercial license. See `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 2 for complete evaluation license terms.

**FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT:** The 30-day evaluation period is for evaluation and testing purposes only. Production use, revenue-generating activities, or use beyond the evaluation period requires a paid commercial license. The 30-day evaluation period described in `LEGAL/SUPPORT_POLICY.md` is for non-commercial evaluation only and is separate from the commercial evaluation period.

### Academic & Personal Use (AGPL-3.0 Only)

**"Non-commercial academic or personal research use"** means:

- Use by an individual in their personal capacity (meaning: not as an employee, contractor, or agent of any business, organization, or other entity; not for the benefit of any third party; and not in connection with any commercial activity, including but not limited to freelance work, consulting, or sole proprietorship activities), or
- Use by a degree-granting educational or non-profit research institution that is: (i) recognized as a tax-exempt organization under applicable law, (ii) not owned, controlled by, or operated for the benefit of any commercial entity, and (iii) where the research results are not used to support commercial operations, trading, revenue-generating activities, or any business purpose of any commercial organization

**EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS FROM NON-COMMERCIAL USE:**
- **Sole proprietorships, freelancers, and independent contractors** — Any use by a sole proprietor, freelancer, or independent contractor, even if claimed to be "personal," requires a commercial license if the Software is used in connection with any business activity, client work, or revenue-generating activity
- **For-profit educational institutions** — Any use by for-profit universities, bootcamps, training companies, or corporate training programs requires a commercial license
- **Corporate training and bootcamps** — Any use for corporate training, professional development, bootcamp instruction, or educational services provided by commercial entities requires a commercial license, regardless of whether the training is provided to employees or external students
- **Corporate research labs** — Any research conducted by, for, or on behalf of a commercial organization requires a commercial license, regardless of whether the research lab has non-profit status or is operated as a separate entity
- **University research with commercial ties** — Research funded by, sponsored by, or operationally integrated into commercial organizations requires a commercial license, even if performed at a non-profit institution
- **Development, testing, and staging environments** — Any use in development, testing, staging, quality assurance, or other non-production environments within a business context requires a commercial license, regardless of whether such environments are labeled as "experimental" or "non-production"
- **Open source contributions** — Contributing code, fixes, or improvements to the open-source version does not exempt Commercial Use (as defined in `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 1) from licensing requirements

**Academic research that is conducted for, funded by, sponsored by, or operationally integrated into a commercial organization's activities requires a commercial license**, even if the research is performed by students, interns, or contractors.

**IMPORTANT:** Use of the AGPL-3.0 version for any commercial purpose (including but not limited to: business operations, trading, investment decisions, client services, or any revenue-generating activity) is a violation of the AGPL-3.0 license terms and may result in copyright infringement claims. If you have used the Software commercially under AGPL-3.0, you must immediately obtain a commercial license and may be required to pay retroactive licensing fees.

**See `DUAL_LICENSE.md` for complete dual licensing information.**
