## General Questions

### Q: What is "Commercial Use"?

**A:** "Commercial Use" (as defined in `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 1) means any use of the Software by or for the benefit of a business, organization, or other legal entity, including:

- Internal use in any environment (development, testing, staging, or production)
- Use that directly or indirectly supports revenue-generating activities
- Use by employees, contractors, interns, or Affiliates in the scope of their work

**Examples include:** internal tools, dashboards, research pipelines, proofs of concept, evaluations, pilot projects, trading systems, investment analysis, client services, and any use within a business or organizational context.

**Key point:** Commercial Use requires a commercial license regardless of whether the use directly generates revenue, is labeled "experimental," "non-production," or "research-only."

---

### Q: Can I use the Software for internal evaluation or proof of concept?

**A:** Organizations can use a 30-day $0 evaluation (strict limits: non-production, no client deliverables). Continued evaluation beyond 30 days requires a paid Pilot ($35k, credited 100% to Year 1 if converted within 60 days). Academic labs may request a $0 evaluation pilot in writing (subject to approval, non-commercial research only).

---

### Q: Can interns, contractors, or consultants use the Software for free?

**A:** No. If they are using the Software in the scope of their work for a business or organization, that constitutes organizational use and requires a commercial license.

Organizational use requires a commercial license. Free use is limited to personal use and non-commercial academic research.

**Key point:** Use by employees, contractors, interns, or Affiliates in the scope of their work for a business entity requires a commercial license, regardless of their employment status.

---

### Q: Can some teams use it for free while others use a commercial license?

**A:** No. Organizational use requires a commercial license. Free use is limited to personal use and non-commercial academic research.

---

### Q: What about academic partnerships or university research?

**A:** It depends on the context:

- **Non-commercial academic research** at a qualifying tax-exempt educational institution (where results are not used to support commercial operations) → Free use permitted (see `LICENSE`)
- **Corporate-funded research** or research sponsored by commercial organizations → Commercial license required
- **For-profit universities** or corporate research labs → Commercial license required
- **Research that supports commercial operations, trading, or revenue-generating activities** → Commercial license required

See `LICENSE` for the complete definition of free academic use.

---

### Q: Can I use the Software for a pre-revenue startup or experimental project?

**A:** Yes, but you still need a commercial license. Commercial Use includes non-revenue or "experimental" usage within a business context. The fact that you are not yet generating revenue does not exempt you from commercial licensing requirements.

**Key point:** Any use within a business, organization, or commercial entity requires a commercial license, regardless of revenue status.

---

### Q: Can I sell outputs (signals, analytics, predictions) to clients?

**A:** Yes, with a commercial license. Licensee may use the Software to provide outputs (including predictions, analytics, signals, or trading decisions) to Licensee's own clients, provided such clients do not receive direct or indirect access to the Software itself.

However, you may not:
- Sell models, algorithms, or systems created using the Software as a standalone product
- Use the Software to build or operate a Competing Infrastructure Service
- Grant third parties direct or indirect access to the Software

See `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 4 ("Model Training and Resale") for complete details.

---

### Q: Can I modify the Software?

**A:** Yes. With a commercial license, you may modify the Software for your own internal commercial use.

However:

- Modifications must remain for your internal use only
- You may not distribute modified versions
- You may not create derivative products that compete with FoxML Core
- Any work that qualifies as a derivative of the Software is owned by Licensor and licensed back to you under the terms of your commercial license

See `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 3 ("Licensee Developments") for complete details.

---

### Q: Can I host the Software on AWS, GCP, or Azure for our internal use?

**A:** Yes, with a commercial license. You may deploy the Software on third-party cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) for your own internal Commercial Use, provided:

- The deployment is for your internal use only
- You do not provide third parties with access to the Software
- You comply with all other license restrictions

See `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 4 for complete hosting and deployment restrictions.

---

### Q: What happens if I've been using the Software for organizational purposes without a license?

**A:** Unauthorized organizational use without a valid commercial license is copyright infringement. You must immediately obtain a commercial license and may be required to pay retroactive licensing fees.

Contact jenn.lewis5789@gmail.com to discuss retroactive licensing.

---

### Q: Can I share a license with a subsidiary or parent company?

**A:** No. Each separate legal entity (including each Affiliate) that wishes to use the Software must obtain its own license. Sharing a single license across multiple entities, even if related, is prohibited and constitutes a Material Breach.

See `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 1 ("Affiliate" definition) and Section 4 ("Use by Affiliates") for complete details.

---

### Q: What if I exceed my seat limit?

**A:** If you exceed the purchased Seats, Licensor may invoice you for the excess usage at Licensor's then-current rates, and you must pay such invoice within thirty (30) days. Repeated or material excess usage (exceeding purchased Seats by more than ten percent (10%) for more than thirty (30) consecutive days) may constitute a Material Breach and grounds for termination.

See `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 3 ("Authorized Users and Seat Limits") for complete details.

---

### Q: Can I benchmark the Software?

**A:** No. You may not publish or disclose to any third party any benchmark, performance, or comparison tests of the Software without Licensor's prior written consent. Any breach of this restriction is deemed a Material Breach and may result in immediate termination.

See `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 4 ("Benchmarking") for complete details.

---

### Q: Can I reverse engineer the Software?

**A:** No. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive or access the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs of the Software, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding a contractual restriction.

See `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 4 ("Reverse Engineering") for complete details.

---

### Q: How do I contact you for licensing questions?

**A:** Email jenn.lewis5789@gmail.com with your inquiry. For physical mail, you must first send an email notification (see `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` Section 24 for complete notice requirements).

## Business License Decision Tree

**Q: Does my hedge fund backtest count?**  
A: Yes. Any use by or for a business requires a commercial license.

**Q: I'm a freelancer doing client work. Do I need a license?**  
A: Yes. Use for client work is business use, not personal use.

**Q: I'm evaluating it for my company. Is that free?**  
A: Organizations can use a 30-day $0 evaluation (strict limits). Continued evaluation beyond 30 days requires a paid Pilot ($35k). If you're a legal entity, you need a license for continued use.

**Q: I'm a student doing research. Is that free?**  
A: It depends. Non-commercial academic research at qualifying tax-exempt institutions is free. If the research is corporate-funded, sponsored, or integrated into commercial operations, a commercial license is required. See `LICENSE` for the complete definition of free academic use.

**Q: I'm a sole proprietor. Is that personal use?**  
A: No. Sole proprietors using Software for business operations require a commercial license.

## Common Excuses (Pre-empted)

**"It's just research."**  
→ If done by or for an organization, commercial license required.

**"It's internal only."**  
→ Internal organizational use requires a commercial license.

**"We're not selling it."**  
→ Revenue generation is not required. Organizational use = commercial license.

**"It's for evaluation."**  
→ Organizations can use a 30-day $0 evaluation (strict limits). Continued evaluation requires a paid Pilot ($35k).

**"It's experimental/non-production."**  
→ Environment label doesn't matter. Organizational use = commercial license.

**"I'm a contractor, not an employee."**  
→ Use for client work or in scope of work = commercial license required.

**"I'm using it personally, not for work."**  
→ If you're a natural person acting solely on your own behalf for non-commercial purposes, that's free. If it's connected to any business activity, commercial license required.

## Common Pressure Tactics (Handled)

**"This should be open source / community-owned."**  
→ FoxML Core is source-available. Free for personal use and non-commercial academic research. Organizational use requires a paid commercial license. This keeps the project sustainable and enables continued development.

**"We can't pay until you prove traction."**  
→ Organizations can use a 30-day $0 evaluation (strict limits). Continued evaluation requires a paid Pilot ($35k).

**"We'll 'evaluate' first" (for months).**  
→ Organizations can use a 30-day $0 evaluation (strict limits). Continued evaluation requires a paid Pilot ($35k).

**"Your pricing is insane."**  
→ Commercial licensing is per team/desk and starts at $120,000/year. See `LEGAL/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for pricing summary and `LEGAL/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md` for details.

**"We'll build it ourselves / fork it."**  
→ You're free to build your own. You can't use FoxML Core in production without a license. Organizational use requires a paid license regardless of whether you fork the code.

**"If you charge, you won't get adoption."**  
→ FoxML Core is source-available. Free for personal use and non-commercial academic research. Organizational use requires a paid commercial license. This keeps the project sustainable and enables continued development.
