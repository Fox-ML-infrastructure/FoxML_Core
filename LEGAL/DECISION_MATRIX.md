## Key Principles

### ✅ Free Use (No License Required)

- Note: Personal use (individual, non-commercial) requires a commercial license
- Non-commercial academic research at qualifying tax-exempt institutions

See `LICENSE` for complete definition of free use.

### ❌ Commercial License Required for Organizational Use

### ❌ Commercial License is REQUIRED for:
1. **Any use within a business, organization, or commercial entity**
2. **Any use that directly or indirectly supports revenue-generating activities**
3. **Any use by employees, contractors, interns, or Affiliates in scope of their work**
4. **Any use in any environment** (development, testing, staging, production) within a business context
5. **Any experimental, proof of concept, or pilot project** within a business context

### 🚫 PROHIBITED under both licenses:
1. **Building a Competing Infrastructure Service**
2. **Reverse engineering**
3. **Benchmarking without consent** (commercial license)
4. **Sharing / loaning / renting licenses**

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "We're just evaluating internally" | ❌ Still requires commercial license — no free trial for commercial use |
| "It's not in production yet" | ❌ Development/testing/staging still requires commercial license |
| "We're not generating revenue" | ❌ Revenue status doesn't matter — business use requires commercial license |
| "It's just research" | ❌ Research within a business context requires commercial license |
| "Our interns are using it" | ❌ Use by employees/contractors/interns requires commercial license |
| "We're a non-profit" | ❌ Non-profit status doesn't exempt commercial use — still requires commercial license |
| "We're a university" | ⚠️ Only non-commercial academic research at degree-granting institutions is exempt — corporate funding or commercial integration requires commercial license |
| "We'll only use it for evaluation" | ⚠️ 30-day $0 evaluation available (strict limits). Continued evaluation requires a paid pilot ($35k) |
| "It's open source, so it's free" | ❌ Source-available means code is visible, but organizational use requires a commercial license |
| "We'll contribute back to open source" | ❌ Open source contributions don't exempt commercial use from licensing requirements |
