> **Document Hierarchy:** This document is provided for guidance only. In case of any conflict, `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` is the authoritative and controlling document for all commercial licensing terms and obligations, `LICENSE` controls for free use, and `HUMANITARIAN_LICENSE.md` controls for the humanitarian exception.

FoxML Core licensing: **AGPL v3 + Commercial + Humanitarian Exception**.

---

## AGPL v3 License (Free Use)

**AGPL v3 is available for:**
- Individual researchers and developers
- Open-source contributors
- Academic use and research
- Evaluation and experimentation
- Projects that can comply with AGPL copyleft requirements

**AGPL Requirements:** If you modify FoxML Core and deploy it as a service (including internal services), you must publish your changes under AGPL v3 unless you have a commercial license.

**See [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE) for the complete AGPL v3 license terms.**

## Commercial License (Required for Proprietary Use)

**Commercial licenses are required for:**
- Proprietary internal use
- Production trading systems
- Closed-source integrations
- Hosted services where you cannot comply with AGPL source disclosure requirements
- Organizations that need to modify and deploy without source disclosure obligations

**Commercial licenses provide:**
- Right to use internally + commercially
- Access to releases during term
- License to modify + integrate
- No copyleft obligations
- Standard commercial protections

## Humanitarian & Public Benefit Exception (Limited, Conditional)

The Humanitarian & Public Benefit Exception is a **limited-use exception** to the standard licensing model. It is not a separate license type.

**Eligible organizations include:**
- Registered non-profit organizations (501(c)(3) or equivalent)
- Accredited academic or research institutions
- Government or public-sector research bodies
- NGOs and charities
- Companies conducting non-commercial humanitarian work (with organizational isolation from commercial activities)

**Conditions (all must be met):**
- No revenue generation (direct or indirect)
- No proprietary embedding
- No resale, sublicensing, or commercial redistribution
- No use for profit optimization or commercial support
- Attribution required

**Key restrictions:**
- Indirect revenue (lead generation, investor signaling, efficiency gains for commercial operations) disqualifies use
- Use must be organizationally and operationally isolated from commercial activities
- Transition to commercial use requires a commercial license

**See [`../HUMANITARIAN_LICENSE.md`](../HUMANITARIAN_LICENSE.md) for complete terms and eligibility FAQ.**
