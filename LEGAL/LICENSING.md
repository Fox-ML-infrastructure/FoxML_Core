# FoxML Core Licensing Model

> **Document Hierarchy:** This document is provided for guidance only. In case of any conflict, `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` is the authoritative and controlling document for all commercial licensing terms and obligations, and `LICENSE` (AGPL-3.0) controls for open-source licensing.

FoxML Core is dual-licensed:

1. **AGPL-3.0** for academic, personal, or open-source research.
   - You may use, study, and modify FoxML Core under AGPL terms.
   - Any network-deployed modifications must be open-sourced.

2. **Commercial License** for any revenue-generating or organizational use.
   - Required for internal company use, trading, forecasting, modeling,
     optimization, operational analytics, or integration into proprietary systems.
   - Allows internal modification and deployment without AGPL disclosure.
