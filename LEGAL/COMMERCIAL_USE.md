> **Document Hierarchy:** This document is provided for guidance only. In case of any conflict, `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` is the authoritative and controlling document for all commercial licensing terms and obligations, and `LICENSE` (AGPL-3.0) controls for open-source licensing.

- You **deploy it in production**
- You **integrate it into proprietary systems**
- You use it in any **revenue-generating activity**
- You **modify it for commercial use**
- You use it to **provide services to third parties**

**Any business or internal use by or for a commercial organization requires a commercial license, regardless of whether the use directly generates revenue.**

### ❌ **NO — You do NOT need a commercial license if:**

- You are using it for **non-commercial academic research** (see `LEGAL/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md` for full definition) at a qualifying non-profit, tax-exempt educational institution
- You are using it for **personal study or learning** (individual in personal capacity, NOT for business, client work, or revenue generation)
- You are contributing to **open-source projects** (under AGPL-3.0) in a non-commercial context
- You are **not using it in production** or for commercial purposes

**IMPORTANT EXCLUSIONS:**
- **Sole proprietors, freelancers, and independent contractors** — Even if claimed to be "personal," any use in connection with business activity or client work requires a commercial license
- **For-profit educational institutions** — Any use by for-profit universities, bootcamps, or training companies requires a commercial license
- **Corporate research labs** — Research conducted by or for commercial organizations requires a commercial license, regardless of non-profit status
- **"Experimental" or "non-revenue" business use** — Still requires a commercial license

**Note:** Academic research conducted for, funded by, sponsored by, or operationally integrated into a commercial organization requires a commercial license, even if performed by students or interns.

**NO FREE TRIAL FOR COMMERCIAL USE:** There is no grace period, evaluation period, or "free trial" for commercial use. Payment is required from the first day of commercial use. The 30-day evaluation period described in `LEGAL/SUPPORT_POLICY.md` is for non-commercial evaluation only.
