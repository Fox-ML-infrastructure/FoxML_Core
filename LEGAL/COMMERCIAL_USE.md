## 1. Do I Need a Commercial License?

### ✅ **YES — You need a commercial license if:**

- You are a **business, organization, or institution**
- You use FoxML Core for **internal operations** (see `LEGAL/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md` for definition of business/internal use)
- You use it for **trading, investment, or financial decision-making**
- You **deploy it in production**
- You **integrate it into proprietary systems**
- You use it in any **revenue-generating activity**
- You **modify it for commercial use**
- You use it to **provide services to third parties**

**Any business or internal use by or for a commercial organization requires a commercial license, regardless of whether the use directly generates revenue.**

### ❌ **NO — You do NOT need a commercial license if:**

- You are using it under **AGPL v3** for open research, experimentation, or projects that can comply with AGPL copyleft requirements
- Your project can **publish modifications** if deployed as a service (AGPL requirement)
- You are contributing to the Software in an open-source context
- You are using it for **personal study or learning** in a non-proprietary context

**IMPORTANT:**
- **AGPL v3 requires** that if you modify the software and deploy it as a service (including internal services), you must publish your modifications under AGPL v3
- **Proprietary deployments** (modifications must remain private) require a commercial license
- **Production systems** that cannot comply with AGPL source disclosure require a commercial license
- **Closed-source integrations** require a commercial license

**Note:** If you cannot comply with AGPL copyleft requirements (publish modifications), you need a commercial license.

**EVALUATION POLICY:** Organizations can use a 30-day $0 evaluation (strict limits: non-production, no client deliverables, no redistribution). Continued evaluation beyond 30 days requires a paid Pilot ($35k, credited 100% to Year 1 if converted within 60 days). Payment is required for continued use after the evaluation period.

**See `LEGAL/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md` for complete definitions and usage scenarios.**
