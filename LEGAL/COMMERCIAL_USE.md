- You are using it for **non-commercial academic research** (see `LEGAL/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md` for full definition) at a qualifying non-profit, tax-exempt educational institution

- You are **not using it in production** or for commercial purposes

**IMPORTANT EXCLUSIONS:**
- **Sole proprietors, freelancers, and independent contractors** — Even if claimed to be "personal," any use in connection with business activity or client work requires a commercial license
- **For-profit educational institutions** — Any use by for-profit universities, bootcamps, or training companies requires a commercial license
- **Corporate research labs** — Research conducted by or for commercial organizations requires a commercial license, regardless of non-profit status
- **"Experimental" or "non-revenue" business use** — Still requires a commercial license

**Note:** Academic research conducted for, funded by, sponsored by, or operationally integrated into a commercial organization requires a commercial license, even if performed by students or interns.

**NO FREE TRIAL FOR COMMERCIAL USE:** There is no grace period, evaluation period, or "free trial" for commercial use. Payment is required from the first day of commercial use. The 30-day evaluation period described in `LEGAL/SUPPORT_POLICY.md` is for non-commercial evaluation only.
