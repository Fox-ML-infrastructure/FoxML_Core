# FoxML Core — Graduated Close Model

**Purpose:** Define what locks when, and why.

---

## Overview

The graduated close model protects the project while maintaining core openness for validation. It's a strategic approach, not a panic response.

**Core Principle:** Core remains open. Production glue is held back.

---

## What Stays Open (Always)

### Core Training Infrastructure
- Training pipelines
- Model evaluation frameworks
- Feature engineering systems
- Safety and leakage detection
- Reproducibility mechanisms

**Why:** Academic researchers and the community need to validate the approach. Core algorithms remain open for study and learning.

---

## What Gets Held Back (v2.0+)

### Production Orchestration Layer
**Status:** 🔒 Closed (commercial license required)

**Includes:**
- Deployment recipes
- Scaling patterns
- Production configurations
- Environment management
- Monitoring and observability tooling

**Why:** This is the "turnkey" layer. Holding it back prevents easy commercial repackaging while keeping core validation open.

### Enterprise Integration Layer
**Status:** 🔒 Closed (commercial license required)

**Includes:**
- Enterprise connectors
- Compliance tooling
- Audit frameworks
- Integration patterns
- Custom adapters

**Why:** Enterprise features are value-adds that justify commercial licensing. Core remains open for validation.

### Performance Optimization Layer
**Status:** 🔒 Closed (commercial license required)

**Includes:**
- Production-grade performance tuning
- Optimization recipes
- Scaling strategies
- Resource management
- Cost optimization patterns

**Why:** Production optimizations are valuable IP that differentiates commercial offerings.

## Version Transition Policy

### v1.x → v2.0 Transition

**Timeline:**
- **90 days notice** before v2.0 implementation
- **60 days:** Detailed migration guide
- **30 days:** Final notice and transition support
- **Implementation:** Graduated close takes effect

**Protection for Existing Users:**
- v1.x remains available under current license terms
- Existing commercial licensees receive v2.0+ access
- Academic researchers retain core component access
- Contributors maintain access to core components

### Backward Compatibility

**v1.x:**
- Remains fully source-available
- Current license terms apply
- No retroactive changes

**v2.0+:**
- Core components: Open (academic free, commercial license for production use)
- Production layer: Closed (commercial license required)
- Enterprise layer: Closed (commercial license required)

## Licensing Model by Layer

### Core Components (Open)
- **Academic:** Free (non-commercial research)
- **Commercial:** License required for organizational use
- **Source:** Fully visible

### Production Layer (v2.0+ Closed)
- **Academic:** Not available (production use requires commercial license)
- **Commercial:** Included with commercial license
- **Source:** Not publicly available

### Enterprise Layer (v2.0+ Closed)
- **Academic:** Not available (enterprise features require commercial license)
- **Commercial:** Included with commercial license
- **Source:** Not publicly available

---

## Enforcement

### What's Protected

**All layers are protected:**
- Core components: Commercial use requires license
- Production layer: Access requires commercial license
- Enterprise layer: Access requires commercial license

**Violations are pursued:**
- Copyright infringement claims
- Injunctive relief
- Monetary damages
- Recovery of attorneys' fees

### Monitoring

**We monitor:**
- Unauthorized commercial use of core components
- Unauthorized access to closed layers
- Derivative monetization
- Competing infrastructure services

## Rationale

### Why This Model Works

1. **Maintains validation openness**
   - Core remains visible
   - Academic research continues
   - Community can validate approach

2. **Protects commercial value**
   - Production layer is valuable IP
   - Enterprise features justify licensing
   - Prevents easy repackaging

3. **Signals authority**
   - Clear boundaries
   - Active enforcement
   - Deliberate strategy

4. **Enables sustainable development**
   - Commercial licensing funds development
   - Core openness maintains community
   - Balanced approach
