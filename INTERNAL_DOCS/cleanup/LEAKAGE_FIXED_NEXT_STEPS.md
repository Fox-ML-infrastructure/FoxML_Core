# Data Leakage Fixed - Next Steps

## What We Found & Fixed

### The Problem
Your initial R² scores of **0.72-0.88** were suspiciously high and indicated **data leakage** - features that contained future information.

### What We Did

1. **Identified 90 leaking features**:
 - `time_in_profit_*` (knows when position becomes profitable)
 - `mfe_*` / `mdd_*` (maximum favorable/adverse excursion - requires future path)
 - `tth_*` (time-to-hit barriers - looks ahead)
 - `excursion_*` / `flipcount_*` (future price path metrics)

2. **Created automatic filtering system**:
 - `CONFIG/excluded_features.yaml` - centralized exclusion list
 - `SCRIPTS/filter_leaking_features.py` - utility module
 - Auto-integrated into your multi-model scripts

3. **Updated all scripts** to:
 - Filter leaking features automatically
 - Use CPU instead of GPU (not available in your build)
 - Work with `trader_env` conda environment

### Status

- **Before**: 531 total columns, 447 used in models
- **After**: 531 total columns, 357 safe features used
- **Removed**: 90 leaking features (17%)

## Next Steps: Run Clean Baseline

Now that leakage is fixed, here's your workflow:

### Step 1: Rank Targets (Find Best Predictable Targets)

```bash
conda activate trader_env
cd /home/Jennifer/trader

# Rank all 63 targets to find which are most predictable
python SCRIPTS/rank_target_predictability.py \
  --symbols AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL,TSLA,JPM \
  --output-dir results/clean_baseline

# This will create:
# - results/clean_baseline/target_rankings.csv
# - results/clean_baseline/target_ranking.log
```

**Expected runtime**: 20-40 minutes for 63 targets × 5 symbols

### Step 2: Select Features (Multi-Model Importance)

Pick the top 3-5 targets from Step 1, then run:

```bash
# Example with a good target (replace with your top ranked target)
python SCRIPTS/multi_model_feature_selection.py \
  --target y_will_peak_60m_0.8 \
  --symbols AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL \
  --output-dir results/clean_baseline/y_will_peak_60m_0.8

# This will create:
# - feature_importance.csv (ranked features)
# - model_comparison.csv (performance by model family)
# - feature_selection_report.md (summary)
```

**Expected runtime**: 10-15 minutes per target

### Step 3: Review Results

```bash
# Check target rankings
cat results/clean_baseline/target_rankings.csv | head -20

# Check feature importance
cat results/clean_baseline/y_will_peak_60m_0.8/feature_importance.csv | head -30
```

## Expected Performance (Honest Numbers)

With clean features, expect:

| Target Type | Honest R² Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Classification** | 0.20 - 0.45 | Excellent alpha for trading |
| **Regression** | 0.10 - 0.35 | Good predictive edge |

**If you see**:
- **R² > 0.70**: Still suspicious - investigate target
- **R² = 0.40-0.70**: ️ Very good, verify no remaining leaks
- **R² = 0.20-0.40**: Excellent for financial data
- **R² = 0.10-0.20**: Good, tradeable with proper risk mgmt
- **R² < 0.10**: Consider different features or targets

---

## ️ Known Issues with Current Targets

Some targets may show inflated R² for other reasons:

1. **Degenerate targets** (only one class):
 - `y_will_swing_high_5m_0.05` (all zeros)
 - `y_will_swing_low_5m_0.05` (all zeros)
 - → These will be auto-filtered by `rank_target_predictability.py`

2. **Nearly deterministic targets**:
 - Some targets may be calculable from recent price action
 - Not "leakage" per se, but not useful for trading
 - → Look for R² in the 0.20-0.50 range

---

## Configuration

### Adjusting Leakage Filtering

Edit `CONFIG/excluded_features.yaml`:

```yaml
# To be more conservative (exclude more features)
exclude_probable_leaks: true  # Default: false

# To exclude custom features
definite_leaks:
  - my_custom_leaking_feature
  - another_bad_feature
```

### Using Full Dataset vs Samples

Current defaults (in scripts):
- Target ranking: **10,000 rows per symbol** (fast screening)
- Feature selection: **50,000 rows per symbol** (thorough)

To use full dataset:

```python
# Edit the script, or pass via config
max_samples = 500000  # or None for no limit
```

---

## Files Modified

**Created**:
- `CONFIG/excluded_features.yaml`
- `SCRIPTS/filter_leaking_features.py`
- `SCRIPTS/identify_leaking_features.py`
- `SCRIPTS/validate_leakage_fix.py`
- `SCRIPTS/quick_multi_target_test.py`
- `SCRIPTS/LEAKAGE_FIX_README.md`

**Updated**:
- `SCRIPTS/rank_target_predictability.py` (auto-filters leaks, uses CPU)
- `SCRIPTS/multi_model_feature_selection.py` (auto-filters leaks)

## Week 1: Clean Baseline (THIS WEEK)

1. **Target Ranking** (20-40 min)
   ```bash
   python SCRIPTS/rank_target_predictability.py --symbols AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL,TSLA,JPM
   ```

2. **Feature Selection** (10-15 min per target)
   ```bash
   # Run for top 3 targets from ranking
   python SCRIPTS/multi_model_feature_selection.py --target <TOP_TARGET> --symbols AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL
   ```

3. **Document Baseline**
 - Save R² scores
 - Note top features
 - **This is your honest performance benchmark**

---

## Week 2: Regime Enhancement (NEXT WEEK)

Once you have a clean baseline, you can:

1. Add **regime features** (safe, high-value):
 - `trend_strength`, `vol_zscore`, `chop_index`
 - Expected R² boost: +0.05 to +0.10

2. Re-run feature selection with regime features

3. Compare: baseline vs regime-enhanced

---

## Philosophy

> **"Honest R² of 0.35 with clean features > Fake R² of 0.85 with leaks"**

You now have a system that guarantees:
- No future information in features
- Reproducible in live trading
- Honest performance metrics

Any alpha you find now is **real alpha**.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "My R² dropped to 0.15!"
**Good!** This is honest. Now add regime features or try different targets.

### "Some targets still show R² > 0.90"
Check if the target is degenerate (one class dominant) or calculated from recent data.

### "Script is slow"
Reduce `max_samples` or use fewer symbols for initial testing.

### "GPU errors"
Already fixed - scripts now use CPU by default.

---

## Ready? Let's go!

```bash
conda activate trader_env
cd /home/Jennifer/trader

# Start with target ranking
python SCRIPTS/rank_target_predictability.py --symbols AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL,TSLA,JPM
```

This will take 20-40 minutes. Grab a coffee!

The results will show you which of your 63 targets are most predictable (with honest metrics).
