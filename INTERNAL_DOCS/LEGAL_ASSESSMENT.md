## ⚠️ **Potential Gaps to Consider:**

**Recommendation:** Add clause allowing you to audit usage

### 2. **Assignment/Transfer** (Partially covered)
**Current:** Non-transferable license
**Gap:** What if company is acquired?
**Recommendation:** Explicitly prohibit assignment without consent

### 3. **Dispute Resolution** (Missing)
**Risk:** Expensive litigation
**Recommendation:** Consider arbitration clause

### 4. **Patent Rights** (Not explicit)
**Risk:** Ambiguity about patent grants
**Recommendation:** Explicitly state no patent grant (or limited grant)

### 5. **Derivative Works Ownership** (Partially clear)
**Current:** Licensee owns internal derivatives but can't distribute
**Gap:** Could be more explicit about what happens to derivatives on termination
**Recommendation:** Clarify derivative works revert or must be destroyed

### 6. **Force Majeure** (Missing)
**Risk:** Liability during disasters/events beyond control
**Recommendation:** Add force majeure clause

## 📊 **Overall Assessment:**

**Grade: B+ (Good, but could be stronger)**

**For a solo developer/LLC, these are solid.** They protect you from:
- ✅ Code theft/redistribution
- ✅ Liability claims
- ✅ Unpaid usage
- ✅ IP infringement claims

**For enterprise sales, consider adding:**
- Audit rights
- Arbitration clause
- More explicit derivative works language
- Assignment restrictions

## 🎯 **Recommendation:**

**Current licenses are good enough to start.** They protect you from the main risks:
1. People stealing/redistributing your code ✅
2. Liability for trading losses ✅
3. Unpaid usage ✅
4. IP disputes ✅

**Consider strengthening when:**
- You get enterprise customers ($100k+ deals)
- You have legal budget for attorney review
- You encounter compliance issues

**For now, you're well-protected for typical commercial licensing.**
