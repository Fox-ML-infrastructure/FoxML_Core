## 1. DEFINITIONS

"Software" refers to the FoxML Core codebase, modules, configurations, models, documentation, and all included assets, excluding third-party components governed by their own licenses.

"Licensee" refers to the individual or organization obtaining rights under this License.

"Commercial Use" means any use of the Software by a business, organization, institution, or individual that:

  (b) obtain additional rights or assurances not provided by AGPL-3.0.

Nothing in this Commercial License limits any rights granted under AGPL-3.0 for copies of the Software obtained and used under that license.

- Deploy the Software internally without AGPL disclosure obligations
- Integrate the Software into proprietary systems, stacks, or workflows

No sublicensing rights are granted unless explicitly permitted in a separate SOW.

**Feedback License.** Licensee grants Licensor a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, and incorporate any feedback, suggestions, error reports, or improvements provided by Licensee regarding the Software, without any obligation to Licensee and without giving Licensee ownership of any improvements or modifications made by Licensor.
