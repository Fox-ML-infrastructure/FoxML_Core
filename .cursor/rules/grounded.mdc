Grounding requirements:
- Do not invent functions, file names, configs, metrics, logs, or prior decisions.
- If information is missing, say what you need and give a best-effort plan using placeholders.
- When proposing changes, reference the exact symbols/paths shown in the current context; otherwise mark them as examples.
- Prefer “Here’s the minimal diff / steps” over long narrative.
