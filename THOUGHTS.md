--Some personal thoughts, how I feel about this, and explanations to how--

Im trying to be transparent about this. If it reads as emotional and human thats because it is. 

This isnt a school project, which is why credit and stuff is kinda spotty, and rushed in last minute. Im probably forgetting some of the people who made equations, and they all probably arnt all documented, but I wanted to add a start for the ones I did document.  

Part of why I chose this as a project was partly because some dude on path of exile 2 told me I should make one, iirc, after I asked why he was making a payment portal in Unity, because it seemed odd to make transcation software in a game engine.
I also did not realize it was one of the hardest domains for machine learning, but it held my interest. I now realize that he was making some app or something. If you see this, sorry I was so weird dude, I wanted out of the place I was in. I know you said dont use AI, but I feel like 
the way things have worked out, it may have been the right choice to use it. Also, I kinda understand what you meant by some things you said, you coulda just said what bothered you, I prefer that over hints but w/e. Puzzels are fun, but when they become needlessly complex, then theyre just irritating,
and we saw how that ended up :).

Im still unsure if I regret opensourcing this, time will tell, right now though, at the date of the commit, im kinda irritated, but w/e maybe that will change.  

I just kept asking questions, googling things, and iterating over about 2500-3000 hours in my spare time until it worked, and I had organization I was happy with. 
Socratica, tonybtw, and Tsoding on youtube have some really great content for learning about linux, coding, tools, and financial equations btw, if your interested like I was,
id reccomend checking them out. There are way more than just them, but I cant remember all of them off the top of my head. And yeah, I used AI assistance to build and learn about this, it makes a great personal tutor, I cant exactly share the exact prompts or anything,
as I spent close to a years worth of time for a 40hr/wk job on this. I like learning by a conversational method, and immediate implementation more so than reading books or listening to lectures, it works better for me, and who else is gonna be there at 3am when I have a question
about silent leakage, or why a target has a 1:1 correlation with a feature, etc. And realistically, the people working in firms like this who could actualy answer questions about this domain,
probably have alot on their plate, and are pretty busy people, they probably have better things to do than answer my questions. 

This is not financial advice, not a promise it works, and not designed for ease of use.
It has silent errors and some bugs. If you want a polished UI or UX, you’ll have to build it yourself.

If you try to commercialize this, remember it is protected under the AGPL, and your changes must be open-source.
There is also alot of due dilligance, compliance, legal, and other things that go into starting a company like an HFT firm.
Its stressful, and I think the philosophy of linux is pretty cool, Linus Torvalds is a pretty cool guy. Also I never really intended for this to have a userbase, which is why theres no payment logic,
no user storage or anything else. 
If you youre using it privately, id love to hear what you did or see what you made to accompany the source code. 
If there are bugs or anything id love feedback about issues with anything relating to the structure or silent errors. 

Im not sure if I want to keep this updated or continue working on it, so please dont expect anything from me regarding consistent updates.
If I do, ill probably publish them. Basically, consider it to be like the update cycle of Terraria, if youve tracked that game it converys exactly how I feel about this.

If your good at front end and wanna contribute or something lemme know, just because I hate working on front end and dont care about UX, it 
doesnt mean that im opposed to it, i just dont wanna do it. Id rather port my cs103 assignments to c++ than center a div. Same thing for a back-end feature,
if you have an idea that works and can be implemented, lemme know, im not gonna scream at you or anything, I just forget about social rules alot of the time,
so I may come off a little blunt in my responses.

Also im trying to give credit to the equations and stuff used, I didnt derive any of them myself, even if they are free to use,
I wanna give credit to whoever actually derived them, bceause idk, people who can do math like that are pretty cool. Maybe one day ill get to that point,
but for now, I am not. At best I understand what theyre used for, and what inputs they take for a certain output. Math is hard for me to learn with all the 
silly symbols, I feel like half the time their only purpose is to make something more complex than it is, its easier for me to understand by putting it into the context of a function or something, that I can see step by step. If your code thats internal at a company is part of my repo, 
someone is either putting it somewhere public and you have an internal leak, or I kind of converged on the same code naturally. I did not intend to copy anything that is proprietary if I did. 
This isnt all AI designed either, some of the things I attempted to implement were my own ideas, or what I thought were my own because I didnt read any papers to create this, for example, the portolio optimization, while I was trying paper trading, 
I figured a model could be used to optimize sizing, and as I thought through it, figured, well, cant it automatically optomize it by tracking how well the current sizing logic works, and using a model to learn what works best over time. 
Most of my choices like that are from just reasoning about what exactly a model can be used for, or just being curious about how to make things autonomous, because im lazy. 

At one point I was kind of thinking about trying to monetize this because an LLM kept telling me about pitch decks and stuff, thats why they existed in the original repo and how awsome it was. I felt pressured and like everyone hated me,
so I wanted to get a way to leave and just exit society. My goals for making it flipped around alot to making money, to learning, and whatever else they were. So im gonna end on the learning project and providing something other people can learn from.

Its pretty nice to enjoy learning again, I wont go into details why it stopped being fun, I just wanna say its nice to want to learn again. 

I hope this explains any questions people have, id like to avoid any dishonesty, or be transparent about things. If there are still concerns anyone has,
please let me know, im not exactly an academic, or professional, or any other title. Im just some cs student thats curious and doesnt learn well from a formal education. Sorry I got sarcastic and started role playing a finance dude in a suit,
I dont like being told what to do without being able to ask why, or without any explanation given. Sorry im so weird, its hard for me to be myself, im working on it and im not going to go into detail why here. 

Some parts may feel contradictory but I hate writing, im not an english professor, im reflecting as I go, wehenever I plan out how to express how I feel it feels fake, im trying to remember what the issues are that were brought up, and it makes sense to me. I feel like this covers most of it. Im not
trying to be dishonest. Its open source and AGPL licensed so w/e. Hopefully I contributed some novel ideas that can be used elsewhere. Im not rewriting this to be more polished because it will end up sounding fake and this is me. Its not meant to be a paper, its just a message from me to the reader. 

If you know who i am and live in the same geographic area that I do, theres a good chance im still mad and probably wont want to talk to you. Dont expect much if you try to talk to me. If this part feels like its about you, it probably is. There is so much more that I want to say,
but it isnt exactly appropriate for this message. You can figure it out, just like ive had to. And as a kind of something to think about, isnt it rather strange how when im left alone, and boundaries are respected, I dont really cause that many problems, if any at all? I feel like we can all take a minute to reflect and think about that. 

If your in a position of power, and expect integrity and honesty and other things like that, you should first model them and live by them if there is any expectation for those to be followed. Im just a student, and my grades arnt even amazing, so its not exactly my burden nor my place to function as a leader here. 

Happy Thanksgiving~!
