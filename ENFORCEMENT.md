# ENFORCEMENT POLICY

This document outlines enforcement, verification, and termination conditions related to
the Universal Additional Permission in EXCEPTION.md.

---

## 1. Enforcement Authority

The copyright holder (Jennifer Lewis) retains full authority to:

- approve or deny institutional use,

- request compliance documentation,

- revoke additional permission,

- enforce AGPL compliance,

- issue legal notices of violation.

---

## 2. Verification Rights

The copyright holder may request reasonable documentation confirming:

- LGBTQ+ nondiscrimination protections,

- the institution's public-interest mission,

- the non-commercial nature of use,

- how financial or operational benefits are reinvested into LGBTQ+ protection or public service.

Institutions must supply documentation within **14 days** of request.

Failure to respond = automatic termination.

---

## 3. Automatic Termination

The Additional Permission terminates **immediately and without notice** if:

- protections for LGBTQ+ individuals are weakened, removed, or not enforced,

- the software is used for any financial profit-seeking activity,

- the software is used for proprietary trading, alpha research, market-making, or speculative activity,

- any benefit is used to harm, surveil, suppress, or disadvantage LGBTQ+ people,

- the institution denies verification or fails to provide documentation.

AGPL rights remain unaffected; only expanded institutional permissions terminate.

---

## 4. Post-Termination Obligations

Upon termination, the institution must:

1. Cease all internal, financial, analytical, operational, or strategic use.

2. Remove the software from internal compute systems.

3. Delete all operational models, forecasts, or derivatives created for institutional use.

4. Retain AGPL rights only for private, non-institutional use.

---

## 5. Intent Override (Anti-Loophole Rule)

The Additional Permission must be interpreted according to its core intent:

**To ensure that all institutional benefit produced from this software protects LGBTQ+ people 
and strengthens public-interest missions.**

Any interpretation that weakens, bypasses, or strategically reframes this intent is invalid.

---

## 6. Reporting Violations

Violations can be reported to:

**Jennifer Lewis**  
Primary Maintainer & Copyright Holder  

(Include institution name, department, nature of violation, and evidence.)
