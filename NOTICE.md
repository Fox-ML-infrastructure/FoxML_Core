# Notice

**Licensing Update (2025-12-17):** FoxML Core is back to **AGPL v3 + Commercial** dual licensing. Sorry about any confusion during the brief licensing model change — that was a mistake, and we've reverted to the standard dual-license model. Everything is working again.

**AGPL v3** is available for open research, experimentation, and projects that can comply with AGPL copyleft requirements. **Commercial licenses** are required for proprietary, internal, or production deployments.

See [`LEGAL/LICENSING.md`](LEGAL/LICENSING.md) for complete licensing information.

**Development Status Update (2025-12-17):** Recent enhancements to reproducibility tracking, metadata generation, and metrics output are now operational. The system is functioning as expected. Development will be paused for a brief period to allow for rest and recovery. We appreciate your continued patience and support.
